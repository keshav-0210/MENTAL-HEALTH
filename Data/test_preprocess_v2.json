            "therapist: hi gabriela i understand that you here today because you been experiencing some low mood . patient: yeah i just then recently i just been feeling down a lot . and i ca really like snap out of it . like sometimes if it happened before i can just like get myself back on track . but recently i just found it really difficult to do it . therapist: so it sound like you been experiencing some low mood and you kind of struggling to get going a bit . patient: yeah yeah definitely . therapist: you had low mood in the past but it kind of you been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently you found that harder . okay so i understand that you you first went to your gp he referred you here about two month ago . and can i ask what what led you to go to the gp in the first place ? patient: and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it wa such a shock like i really wa expecting it . and it got me really down and felt really lonely and and i did really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me i should probably go to the doctor and and he is her family to you . therapist: okay so it sound like you had that breakup and you were expecting it . so kind of came out of the blue a bit and and that you been on your own quite a lot . so you not been seeing people a much and it sound like your mom notice that there been a bit of a change in you . okay and how thing been then since then since that happened and since you went to the gp ? patient: i just nothing really changed nothing really improved . i feel down like absence and feel distant from thing and like i said i ca stop all over . therapist: okay and how did you feel about coming here today ? patient: and i wa kind of disappointed in myself because i feel like maybe else my age doing this like i should have been able to snap out of it . like it just another thing that i not really affect me make me stand out for the wrong reason . therapist: okay so you feel like it kind of odd or unusual to be here coming to see a clinical psychologist i suppose i just want to reassure you that it absolutely normal to have feeling of depression and anxiety . it really very common and it certainly is auto strange at all . so it sound like it wa actually quite hard for you to come here today . so what i guess led you to do that because it sound like maybe there wa a lot pushing you against coming here today but you managed to come anyway . patient: and i just hoping that it going to help . i think i did i did really want to admit it because like it just another failure . but my mom wa talking to me and and she she not really happy with the way i behaving and i do really want to disappoint her again . and so i thought there no harm in this therapist: so sound like partly you doing it then your mum because you a bit worried that she she is pleased with you at the moment . patient: yeah . therapist: okay . and i think it great that you come here . and definitely there a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we going to be doing which is called cognitive behavior therapy . and i tell you a bit more about that a we go on but i just trying to find out a bit more about you today . so i saw from your note that your medic student patient: yeah and not currently in the unii room and but yeah last year a a medical student therapist: okay so i guess what why what what the reason that you not in uni this year ? patient: and i like he is pretty tall fast a a then suggested i took a year out . this is the break . therapist: okay so just thinking that would be about six month ago wa it that your ear out started and it sound then maybe like your first year wa also quite tough . patient: yeah wa that i thought we still for everyone but obviously we take it in different way daily . therapist: and you planning on the panning on returning . patient: and yeah i am gon na have to really so . yeah therapist: do sound too sure about that though ? patient: i think return is probably that what gon na make everyone happy . and i think you know at least i be able to finally achieve something and get something right . so yeah like next year i going to get through it . yeah . therapist: okay so it doe it doe sound like you want to go back . patient: i do . and i do . enjoy it i just i just do feel like mate the main man and i just it a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that what come with it and you know it work out for the best if i go . therapist: okay so i guess in there quite a lot of thought and feeling about going back at the moment . and i just wondering in the meantime what are you what are you up to what have you been doing ? patient: and i not really had much on the horizon men more men have friend owns a restaurant . and like she suggested that did a better way to sit in there . just deliver a bit like money and stuff because i seen that in uni . so you know i done that . therapist: okay how many shift have you done there ? patient: and i only done one so far . and yeah i do know whether it something that i probably go back to but therapist: okay . how when wa that shift ? patient: it wa last week actually . therapist: okay and how wa it i suppose i intrigued . can you tell me a bit more about that ? patient: umm it wa it wa different you know because it wa like i could . i did enjoy it because there like it just different aspect and i had to like speak to people and like try to get their order and try to remember it and stuff . like i wa very good . but i suppose like it wa handy to have some money and like get out of the house . therapist: so it sound like you quite enjoyed that then ? patient: yeah . therapist: and what make you think you were very good ? patient: i just i just bit slow and people sometimes they did stand by science so i have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the order . and then just do really think that i not really like a friendly . like people do really think that i a friendly person . they did really want to talk to me and stuff . i felt like i wa like inconveniencing them by like asking them thing and getting thing wrong . but yeah they said they said that apparently and most people got like a few mistake on the fascia . but then again she my mom friend so probably why she saying it . therapist: so the person who owns the restaurant is your mom friend . patient: yeah . therapist: okay so it say you saying that you think you were very good that because you a bit slow and you got confused with some order . patient: yeah . therapist: is it ? you said it common for people to do that . well on that first shift that a she said toe patient: but and but it probably just she just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because i obviously not very good at it . like i not very good for any thing recently . i think she just felt sorry for me . therapist: okay so i just been noting down some of those thought that you been having . you kind of so you feel like you not very good you slow . you confused with the order and you feel like you inconveniencing her and she feel sorry for you . and i suppose i wondering i mean what make you think that she feel sorry for you ? patient: like like such a my mother friend and she obviously feeling sorry for my mom a well because she got a daughter it not like anyone else who harried and she just like all alone and she not getting involved so i think she just feel sorry for me and she doe want to extend until upset me . yeah . therapist: when you having these kind of thought because that quite a lot of negative thought you describing how do you feel ? patient: i feel empty . i do . i just calling a it is and just call it a reality . and i feel like i being honest with myself by just leasing it and not trying to get around tighten it because no i can see myself therapist: so it sound like you feel like these thought are very true then . i mean if you going to write them so i going to pick out some of those thought you describe . you said i not very good and i inconveniencing them . how much would you say you believe those on a scale out of ? where is like i absolutely believe it and zero like i do believe it at all . patient: about therapist: so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay . and you said that when you thinking those thought she started to feel quite empty . patient: i just feel just like sad . i not really myself . i just like it like i not really bad but when i am coming through good job and therapist: there any other emotion that you experience ? patient: feel drained . they feel like i in touch with anything and just like everything going on around me but i just not there . i just if i can just walk in therapist: okay so you feel empty distance you feel drained and how when you feeling these emotion how do you feel in your body ? kind of what sensation do you notice ? patient: i did know how to describe it . i got like i have a bit of like we can have any kind of got like butterfly in your nerve and stuff . therapist: did you have butterfly that night when you at the restaurant ? patient: yeah i wa pretty nervous then . but when i got into it they went away and like it just talked to me for a bit . and so obviously i realized that i wa doing a very good job . therapist: okay and when you when you have these emotion how doe it affect your energy level ? do you feel more energetic le energetic or about the same ? patient: i am feeling down therapist: yeah . and when you having those emotion that you were describing patient: i feel drained like then you will have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes because y play le and le than the body having and i do want to . therapist: yeah sound like you feel very tired . you struggling to wake up . you said it pointless . and then what do you do then when you feel like that ? so i guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning and you feel heavy and i suppose you been maybe having some of these thought and those emotion potentially the night before ? what do you then do ? how do you respond to that ? patient: i just have to go expose that do really have a choice because my mom i live with my mom and i know it hard for her . so i do want her to be too worried . so i just i just tried to carry on a normal girl take longer and i do want to but i do . so now it my routine . therapist: so you a bit slower and get getting up . patient: yeah . therapist: but you are still getting up anyway . and what about your kind of what do you think about when you doing that ? patient: i just thinking that nobody else is like mate my age like maybe we should be feeling like this . and i the only one that doe . therapist: so it sound like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about hey how can it hapen to me ? patient: i do i do want to feel like this but i do and nobody else i know door . so it make me feel even more alone get me even more down . i just do display anyone and i should have anyone to it . therapist: okay so it sound like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit . tell yourself to work harder to be different . okay . and when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how doe that make you feel ? doe that make you feel better afterwards or worse ? patient: feel worse because it still ca snap out of it . like i aware it happening and i just i trying but i just ca . and then and then it just another thing that i feeling . just another thing that i ca really get",

patient: probably like an eight or nine i i ca be in time because nothing attend my field . there too many factor but i feel like i determined to therapist: why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven ? patient: because i do know i feel determined to to make sure this happens because i do like how i felt after i betrayed my mother . i do like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting . therapist: umm hmm patient: it not a pleasant experience . it not something that i wish to enjoy . so like even if i do drink i do want to drink to the point where that happens . like all the fun that i have then prior to that just it not worth it not worth drinking . therapist: right ? what do you think a realistic goal for you then ? patient: to make sure i have my study ? well first try to get back my trust with my mother . therapist: okay patient: then just focus on my study . then if i have time for leisure time like i go party with my friend and just be a a party with them doe mean i have to drink and i do . one cup is not gon na do anything to my life either . but i prefer not to do that i prefer just make sure therapist: your goal to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment . patient: exactly . just so i take part with the social convention but it not . hey guy . it about doing the yeah . therapist: chris i really appreciate you talking with me about this . i know it seems like something that been on your mind a it is . and you know like i said i really care about you a a student and an athlete and want what best for you . so i glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward . you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all . and if you find yourself in a situation where there alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum . sound like something that work for you . patient: and thank you for listening and listening to me . therapist: yeah it my pleasure . it part of my job and part i like best so we better hurry up and get changed for practice .",

            "therapist: elizabeth how you doing today ? patient: um all right . therapist: how thing been going since the last time we met ? patient: it about the same . i still feeling pretty down . i mean i just feel really stuck and not happy and i just do know why . therapist: okay so there a few thing going on there . you said you feeling stuck ? not happy . and some sound like a little confused a to what going on what causing it . you have any suspicion about what might be causing ? patient: i mean i been feeling like really isolated lately . you know because i a stay at home mom . it hard . there not a lot of people . you know right at my fingertip to spend my time with you know obviously my family but um so i guess you know i kind of i had some friend in the neighborhood but like our friendship just kind of fizzled out . and i ever since then it just like i do really feel like doing much . i just kind of feel like what the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff . you know i used to you know shop for the grocery all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kid ready for school in the morning and i still do that stuff . but a lot of time you know i let it slide . sometimes i wo make dinner or whatever . and when i do do it i just feel like i forcing myself to do it . the passion is gone . therapist: and how long have you been ? you say housewife right ? how long you been the housewife ? patient: for a long time i have two boy . they eight and and i been staying home since my first one wa born . so year and you know it it been really rewarding for me i not really interested in going back to work or anything like that . because i know people always say you you know you feeling unfulfilled like you should go back to work but it not it . you know i felt happy with it for so long . i do think that it being home . i think it some thing inside of me . therapist: something changed . so for a long time you were satisfied in housewife you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life . and somewhere along the line something changed in you . and now you not happy with it . so what it represents in term of activity like caring for your child and shopping ? no that what changed . patient: yeah exactly . well i guess you know my youngest is eight . so he only been in school for a couple of year . so i guess like it not super recent but recently he i finally have no child in the home . so it more it more time to myself . and i kind of fill that gap a little bit with other thing . like i did cub scout with the boy for a while . and like i said i had some friend around the neighborhood so that kind of like fill that time . but now that stuff it just not really happening anymore . so now i kind of feel like it not it not boredom you know it not like i do have enough to do . it like i do want to do anything . but then at the same time i feel frustrated because there nothing to do . therapist: so you you frustrated with your situation maybe with yourself a little bit . patient: yeah i think a lot more with myself because i know that i would feel better if i you know maybe found more friend or found something to do with my time but i do want to at the same time so i frustrated with myself because i know i kind of know what would help but then i do really have the like the volition to do it . therapist: you not motivated ? patient: yeah i not motivated . therapist: have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning ? ha anyone else noticed that you down ? patient: yeah i mean obviously my husband ha noticed because he ha to get the boy ready in the morning . he really supportive . i know he can tell that i not feeling the same . but you know he work . and then he ha to come home and pick up my slack . so he getting frustrated which i understand . and you know my mom ha said to me that you know she think i not doing a much and so it kind of hurt . it feel like everybody trying to tell me i lazy and then i not doing enough and it always that like feeling you know like nobody really understands how much work that go into being a mother but then at the same time now that i doing le and le i feel like they all right . you know i am lazy . i not doing anything therapist: they used the word lazy . patient: no no not that i can remember . i you know i think my mom said like you not doing a much a you used to and i kind of took offense to that even though it kind of true . it like i do know . it hurt . therapist: okay that wa painful for you . what about what your husband said ? patient: you know i think at first we did really acknowledge it . it wa like you know i took a break here . he picked up the slack and it wa fine but now that it been and more he kind of getting frustrated and you know he been asking me about how i feel and why i not doing a much but at the same time like even though he know that i not motivated it still frustrating because i it my responsibility . so i think he you know he been saying like i need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said i need you to do more . therapist: what wa your response to that ? when i said i need you to more ? patient: i started cry because i know he right and that what i tell myself every day i need to do more but i do have the motivation to do it . and so i so frustrated with myself . and you know i know that he need that from me and i do know why i not motivated to do it . therapist: okay so you frustrated forfeeling down ? patient: yeah therapist: and you frustrated for lacking motivation ? patient: hmm therapist: and just a little a a few year ago you did feel it this way at all ? patient: yeah . yeah i actually think you know i been feeling this way more like in the past like six month or something like that like i it wa hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like the natural way that it is hard . but this is something else this is more consuming . it you know like the difficulty of him going away to school almost wa motivating like it wa hard but at the same time it wa freeing because i had other opportunity to do stuff . this is just like stunting . therapist: okay so i gon na shift gear a little bit . can you tell me about your well a recent day ? so it kind of typical what you telling me now meaning not motivated down ? patient: sure . onn wednesday i wa having a really hard time getting out of bed . so my husband just got the kid ready in the morning and i felt really bad about that . so i just stayed in bed for a couple more hour probably until like . and i got up you know i made myself something to eat . and then i thought you know i should probably go to the store because we almost out of milk . and you know and i think the boy need shampoo but i just i just sat down and i just sat there and i think i sat for i do even know how long the boy came home from school . it wa like you know and i had even gotten up . and so then i said okay the boy are home . i should probably get started on dinner soon because my husband will be home soon . and i found i found something in the fridge to make and i made dinner and you know after that everybody you know just sat down we just watch tv and i just sat there until it wa time to go to bed . therapist: this is you said this wa recently right ? patient: ummhuhh therapist: what would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done ? patient: i wish that i would wake up and you know i would want to wake up when it wa time for the kid to get ready to school to go to school . you know i could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed i could pay for lunch and get the boy dressed and you know check they needed any permission slip sign that kind of thing . send them out the door and then i would see if we needed anything from the store . i probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house . i used to like have like a list of chore that like i would do different thing on different day and different day of the month and stuff . so like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing . so i would probably like follow that list . nowadays i just you know if it get done it get done and usually my husband help me with some of the stuff and you know i would do the bathroom one day a week that probably get done like once a month now . but um i would do that so do the cleaning . if we if i needed to go to the story we do that . i get ready for the boy to come home i probably make them a snack and and figure out what wa going to be for dinner i would go ahead and do that . and then probably you know sometimes we we would watch tv after my husband got home after dinner or i would figure out something for u to do we could play a board game or or watch a movie a a family or something like that . and that would be after the kid did their homework and everything like that . and then after we spent some time together i put them in a bed . therapist: alright so it a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in term of behavior and where you want to be . so let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first thing in the day you would mention that when it wa time to get up . right ? you did . so you were awake and aware of it but you went back to sleep . and of course your husband got up and he took care of thing . patient: right . therapist: how did you feel alone not to happen because clearly that not what you want to happen . how did you feel about oversleeping ? patient: i just like you know the alarm go off and i know it time to get up and my husband getting out of bed and i just look at the clock and i think what the point and you know it just this instant feeling of i ca even describe it like pointlessness of getting up . and so i go back to sleep but i feel worse for doing it . you know like it a catch like i do want to wake up i just do want to but then when i go back to sleep i feel bad . i feel guilty . therapist: okay so i not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty but you also mentioned something that you thought which wa if i not mistaken you said what the point can you expand on that ? patient: it just it just like you know when i sleeping i do realize how sad i am . and i do realize how hard it is to function . when i sleeping . i not aware of that a soon a i wake up i am . and so i just have this feeling of like what the point of getting up and experiencing these feeling when i could go back to sleep and not have to therapist: what the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back ? patient: yes yeah . therapist: okay . but then when you when you do get up you feel sad and guilty about having overslept . patient: yeah yeah definitely definitely . therapist: so really functionally what you doing is you delaying experiencing the pain . patient: yeah therapist: and then in term of how it affect your relationship and your family you not getting your kid off to school . your husband getting real frustrated . patient: yeah therapist: and all you really bought yourself is a couple extra hour sleep . and you know presumably without without pain because you sleeping but you not really escaping it . doe that make sense ? patient: yeah . therapist: before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose did you get up and help the kid off to school ? patient: yeah it wa so easy . i would just like you know i would wake up and and i would be like okay it time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go . i mean you know sometimes if if if i wa a little bit tired it would be a little bit harder . you know it not you know a a stay at home mom i usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kid are older and everything so it not usually too hard to get up and i would i would you know it would be another good day you know i would be glad to get up and take care of the thing that i needed to take care of and i felt accomplished . therapist: so maybe what going on here ? or maybe maybe we could help you remember you know over the last few session we talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different technique that i be using and different thing we talking about sometimes with behavior the behavior that useful which in this case i assuming we can agree is the getting up on time . behavior that useful ha to come first even if the feeling doe match . right . so sleeping those extra i presume you a couple hour delay you from feeling sad but it cause other problem . if you were to get up one time you might still feel sad right ? because that why you over sleeping a you sleeping longer to avoid that . but the functional part of being a housewife a you identify would be completed . so maybe some of those feeling of sadness and guilt would over time abate . because functionally speaking you completing the task that you want . what tough about that so in the moment it easy for me to say this now . but in the moment like for instance when you have to get out of bed tomorrow you going to be facing that same challenge which is i can get up now and feel depressed or i can wait and feel depressed later . so in that moment it hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards . i mean it sound like you want to get up and patient: yeah i mean i want everything to be normal again . and i guess i never really thought of it like that . like i just thought well if i waking up at the right time and i just feeling bad then like like i said what the point but i guess it make sense . like even if i do feel like doing it maybe it make me feel better if i do do it even if it hard because nothing is really harder than when i already going through . therapist: well it seems like you you more or le making thing worse right ? in an effort to avoid the pain that you going to suffer anyway . you making the pain worse and just delaying it a little bit right . what what thought and we talked before about automatic thought these thought that come up when your belief system meet these different situation that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless . right and i going to expand on my thought a little and say that you know that thought really getting at is i can avoid this pain if i sleep a little while longer . that a version of the thought . patient: doe that make sense ? and also i guess i thought that no it would really be that beneficial to get up . therapist: okay . so minimizing the benefit . patient: yeah . therapist: so there a couple of thing going on right ? i can avoid the pain by slipping in . and there really no point to getting out because i wo do any good anyway . patient: yeah . therapist: what adaptive response is that self talk we talked about those thing we consciously think to ourselves could you apply in that moment when you you know whatever time you get up in the morning when you thinking about this that thought come in that it doe really matter if i get up anyway . patient: i mean i guess i could tell myself like i can do this . like instead of you know when i say to myself what the point instead i can say i can do this ? i can get out of it . it be okay . i can . i strong enough even though it hard to push through the pain and get up now even though i do want to i can say i can do this . therapist: okay . so that would be adaptive response . i strong enough . i can get through this but it will be difficult . right ? how about the value of getting up early and seeing the kid off to school . the automatic thought right now is telling you that not valuable . but i think that you believe it is valuable . patient: yeah i mean i know it valuable . i guess what my frustration is is that i know it valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like pride and and satisfaction and now i not getting that anymore . so i guess i need to realize that even though i not getting it right now . if i keep trying maybe it will happen again because it did happen before therapist: it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back . if you do get up then if you guess that true right ? patient: so never get the satisfaction of sending my kid off to school by never send my kid off to school therapist: she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this wa asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do . patient: i never thought about it like that . therapist: that kind of make sense ? patient: yeah yeah . therapist: so even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move . logically you know that ha a better chance of paying off for you and i think that with with these type of what you going through is probably depression . right now what i like to talk to you further to make sure that what going on seems like you depressed and sometimes with depression you just have to get one thing going your way each day . right ? so so i not saying necessarily tomorrow you have to get up one time and then go make new friend and then go find social activity right ? you do have to build rome in a day here . right ? it it more like can i do this one thing ? okay i proved to myself just what i saying which is i strong enough to get up . see the kid often have that one victory for tomorrow . right and build on that . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: and part of that going to be playing those adaptive response back right thinking of those thought . whether it just thinking them you know in your mind or actually thinking them and saying sometimes it helpful just to say them out loud patient: not letting the negative thought take over because that what i thinking like okay i can get the kid off to school but after that i going to start thinking you know what the point again ? like what ? why do i just sit down there just no point . so if i can keep reminding myself that i just have to try and that i did accomplish something and then you know even though it hard and i know that those thought are going to come back and then i going to feel bad . if i do do anything i not going to feel any better . therapist: so you have a good handle on the adaptive response sound like right . and you know what you have to say after but you know what you want to do . i see again in a week and there be five day in there between now and my see again we will have to decide they want to get up a your kid off to school or not right . so i want you to give that a tryto adaptive response and try to push through with that behavior . now it important to keep in mind that we have five day between now i want to see you again in five business day right ? school day and you may not succeed every day . and that okay . right ? patient: hmmm therapist: sometimes the setback like you could you could get up early two day in a row and then it go up back up third day do let that will wash away those success . it a day by day fight try not to think of it in term of the week i want you to try to think of it in term of what i have to do today . not worrying about the future and not worrying about should done in the past . patient: okay therapist: the only moment we really can live in is now . so try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive response and try to push for that just that one victory . okay can you try that ? patient: yeah i think i can try that . therapist: all right . so work on that and to continue with the homework that maybe the cbt homework have given you and i see you next week . patient: thank you . therapist: thanks",

            "therapist: are you doing today ? patient: good . how you doing ? therapist: i doing well . thanks for asking . i understand you had some symptom recently they been bothering you . patient: yeah . therapist: could you tell me about those ? patient: yeah probably for the last eight month maybe a year even you know i have this position at work where i have to make these weekly presentation and and it killing me . i ca do it anymore . therapist: tell me about how these presentation are set up . patient: so it a it it the executive director and it manager we kind of sitting in a circle and everybody go around and doe like a weekly program update . five minute or so maybe . at the most if there an issue that kind of need to be adjusted . and but everybody take turn speaking and it go around kind of around in a circle . and you know depending on where you said is what order you present and basically therapist: and you say that this situation the presentation you said it killing you . patient: yeah therapist: would feeling so you have patient: i feel like it constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation . and even though i only have to speak for like five minute i so consumed by by this part of my job that i ca i ca do anything else and i normally feel like i do good in my job but but this and you know it just it build up more like every day the day before is is really bad because i prepping for the meeting . and so it really start to consume me then i do sleep the night before . and then by the time you know i get to the meeting i i so anxious and so nervous i panicking and everything and i just ca . i just ca . therapist: so so this is this is distressing for you . therapist: and this is probably difficult to to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what going on then ? patient: by the beginning of the meeting when i sat down i i i feel like i breathing harder . i starting to sweat . and i feel like my face is turning red . my palm are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pant . i my heart is racing . and i feel like you know the closer it get to being my turn i feel like everything just get worse . i feel like i breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder . i feel like everybody can hear it . my stomach just get in knot i feel nauseous . and i ca you know there have been time that i managed to like just hold my hand still and just sit really still . and i tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through . and i have have made it to my my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when i speak i stutter and i stammer over my word and i do say everything i need to even i have a cheat sheet essentially . and i can reframe it . i still feel like i missing thing and i leaving thing out and my voice doe project so i end up speaking very softly and like i said i stuttering i just ca get it . even then it it still i feel like it still a mess . therapist: you not you not happy with the quality of your prison . now even even when you able to kind of stay there and conducted so i want to divide this into the stage . so we talked about the very beginning . so you already having anxiety sound like it fairly intense at that point . tell me about a they go around the table and give their brief presentation . tell me about what you feeling a a the presentation come around to you . patient: well if i if i manage somehow to get there early enough and i can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my bos or like like one or two away then i actually pretty okay . because i can i can kind of get it over and done . but so many time i so nervous and honestly a bit hungover because i been drinking too to try and i do feel anxious want to drink . so there have been a lot of time that i i woken up a little bit late because i been drinking . and so by the time i get there like one of the last it one of the last seat so i one of the last to go . and so a it get closer and closer to me i just feel more and more anxious and panicky . and here in especially in the last few week i had to leave i can say i got to go . therapist: so before before the presentation come around to you you get up and yeah leave the room . so in those time when you stayed in the room and you done the presentation so the anxiety the anxiety the panic the heart rate sweaty palm all these symptom are increasing a they go around the table or the room and when it come to you actually giving your presentation . you not happy with that but what string it level like during your presentation . patient: i feel like during the presentation i feel almost like everything . so everything stop . and then and then when it done and it go to whoever next . it like it almost like a physical sense of relief . like okay that over and everything start to relax and calm down but then i feel miserable . i am so so upset with how i performed that that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like what is wrong with her but that my bos especially is like why did i give her this job again and i feel so so miserable that that i i feel like i disappointed him and i so i disappointed me . and i mean this ha always always happened to me . for a long a i can remember i never been able to speak in front of group and you know from back in college . if i had to make a presentation i would ask the teacher if there a way out of it . and if they refuse then i would present . and i had a teacher who insisted that i make the presentation and i dropped the class and i took it again with a different teacher that would make me present because i could do it . and high school is the same that i would you know i just would do it . and actually this is ridiculous . you know i mentioned drinking . i been drinking for a really long time . when i wa like i do know like or i got busted for underage drinking and i had to do some like adolescent treatment and i had to do this like group therapy with these other kid and i could do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever . therapist: see if you had these symptom for a long time they been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you have had to be in front of other people . patient: um well if i have had to be in front of other people i been i been kind of okay you know i can go to the movie but i like to sit on yet and you know i can go out with with my family and my friend and we can go shopping but i do like to go to new place . i like to go kind of like the same place that have familiar yeah yeah . cuz because i know them . you know i know the layout of store and thing like that . therapist: so it interferes with your functioning . maybe a little bit . but if you not having to present it not a big a deal a it is now for you . yes job . patient: yes therapist: it really affecting it . so are you taking any measure ? or have you take any measure other than drinking you mentioned to avoid a situation to avoid ? patient: oh definitely . i mean there like i said i mean i run out of the meeting . there been time that i called in sick when i have been there been time when i i said i had car trouble arrived so late that it wa unreasonable to make my presentation . i actually talked to my bos about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my note to him or to brief him before after and because i have to say that i have this problem . i mean normal people do do this right ? i mean normal people can make these present like the rest of the staff can do it why ca i ? and so i do want to tell him that you know i that there something wrong with me . i mean it it gotten to the point that i talked to him about you know this other position that in another department and transferring so that i would have to do this anymore . and and it would it would be a pay cut . i mean it a demotion but i ca live like this . therapist: this is too painful . if you had the other job his other job would involve presentation . so you be happier . you have fewer symptom in that job . what been the result of that discussion ? ha there been anything ha happened a far a well . patient: he ha told me that he think something in a good job patient: excuse me and he doe want me to . here what i going to change position . but i ca i ca do this anymore . therapist: all right so you you tried you try to cope with anxiety . you had to leave colon

patient: that way i can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case therapist: right . so the idea is this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequence you fear of touching thing that are contaminated and not washing doing your ritual . right . okay perfect . so did you write the story ?

patient: like . okay . therapist: all right . so just keep visualizing this . i going to describe it now . and you just stay with that image a much a you can . so you in the house and the baby sleeping and you trying to get some housework done and do thing for dinner . suddenly you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jump up and you get upset and anxious because you know that mean he need to go out . and joe is not going to be home for hour . and you really do want to take him out . but you have to . and it make you sick and tired and upset because you not going to use the glove that you always use when you have to take them out . so you walk toward the door and you think well maybe i just make them wait . but you realize how wake the baby up if you do take . so you go toward the leash and it just make you even more anxious to see it . and it dirty . and it chewed up and it gross and you see stain on it . and you think about what those are from and maybe they from dog poop and that going to get on you . and you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar . and a you go out the door and he lunge outside he pull that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash entering your body through the pore of your skin and you feel like it just running up your arm through your bloodstream . and you keep thinking oh my god what if i get sick from this what if what if there some germ in this or bacteria but you keep walking him until he finish what he ha to do and bring him back inside the house . take the leash off . and the urge to wash is so powerful so strong you want to go scrub your hand and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these term off from the leash . but you do do that . you know to make yourself not do the ritual . and then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing thing but that the sense of feeling sick is staying with you and worrying about what going to happen if you picked up germ from the leash . at night you go to sleep still anxious still upset about what happened . wake up in the morning . and then before you have your eye open even a couple minute you know that you sick you can feel your body being sick you rush to the bathroom and vomit you can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right . you sick . and you know it because you handled that lesion did wash you did do the washing you needed to do . and now you sick and the baby will probably get sick . and if only you had done the washing okay ?

no problem which wa not being able to complete the task ? therapist: four is it worth once you go through ? patient: um is it like anxiety over when i finished the test ? yeah yeah after i finished . i mean i know i could do perform better if i wa going because i knew it would take me a long if i wa anxious . um it seems to me like time test and so when it over whether it an hour or two hour or however long it is maybe it over . you know i anxious during it but when it over . yeah it kind of subsides just like in car like when i get to the place after i off the interstate and stuff it seemed to subside . so when the situation is over it seems to seems to go down . therapist: so sound like you might need to find something that help . patient: yeah i also think that the time tell me in the moment because these are thing that i mean i ca avoid . i mean even in my job to i got to go my field placement . i got to do these group setting you know i got to do and kid are crazy . they disrespectful like okay i got to do it though . so all these thing i have to do . i ca change them and my wife right now so got to figure out how to deal with it better . therapist: would you like to describe that ? patient: yeah i very eager to learn something that can make a difference . therapist: well there something called grounding do you know ? patient: no just lectricity grounding you know that third floor thing that only grounding i know . i need to be grounded . that sound good . bring it on therapist: so with grounding a lot of people have a lot of emotion okay to have emotion but for some people it get really intense like a lot and no one want to bring that down to more of a calm place . so it doe necessarily solve the problem like there still traffic . yeah nothing going on which just help you get to a place to deal with patient: that sound good . therapist: so i going to introduce a grounding technique to you okay and involves some deeper event in closing the eye and getting to your sens . okay so i have a little script . okay patient: okay . okay . therapist: they tell me after . i be like okay patient: okay okay . therapist: but somebody gave me i just want to know relax comfortable comfortable resting hand on your side whatever wa working for you pretty good . i do want you to disappoint chest rise so do worry about it . just okay what is comfortable now we gon na gauge and use in each of the five sens . and so for that i want you to close your eye i want you to listen to my voice read my instruction so let begin to relax by just noticing all the sound around to start with . patient: the air conditioning going on over the air coming through therapist: for the constant noise ? patient: umm yeah therapist: notice the sound before like that ? patient: no just hearing it now therapist: let move on to smell do you smelling anything ? patient: just totally okay a lot of sense right now in this room is for smelling bad or good it just normal yeah no any smelly smell nice no air . therapist: now to open up about site so i just listening something so a you can see in this one right now you picture right there dear or whatever it is . what about the color of what you see on ? patient: blue red and a lot of bage orange clashing color . red and orange is one of those go together . therapist: yeah when he first came here did you notice ? patient: mean i might have noticed some of it but i obviously more aware because i really focusing on it right now . so i more aware of it right now . therapist: and so maxwidth taste notice i can just tell you some other situation you can take the time to like snack or something . talk about the taste the texture . well it totally the food and feel . okay ? patient: okay . therapist: you can still do even without food just simply face enough saliva . okay ? patient: okay . okay therapist: something new this morning ? patient: well kind of granola bar and banana earlier . so get some tea just the flavor right now my mouth is probably the tea that i just had most recently . therapist: and then finally we touch on science . so when you hand on right now ? patient: i had this kind of a habit of mine to kind of feel my hand . my hand are supposed to be here therapist: describe to me how it feel ? patient: it wa solid or solid soft rubber or anything like that secure like okay it it gon na hold me . that good feeling comfortable just comfortable . therapist: so what we just able to just went through each of the sens a a way of a bit of extraction from here . this also can be called a lying down to the detail and then something else at the end you can say so how doe that feel ? patient: well wow . he kind of did calm me down . i mean i wa kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious . and so i wa kind of revved up and then i kind of forgot about it because i wa focusing on you know what i wa seeing and what i wa feeling and when i wa you know all my sens of so it wa very distracting . damon a good way i got my mind off of that and kind of got me on to something else . and then yeah they really did cut me down . therapist: wa there a certain sense that you were most help ? patient: troubling right here since i not eaten ? probably what i seeing and what i hearing those two thing seem to be most helpful in this situation . yeah that feeling too . therapist: so let talk about how we can use this because obviously ca close your eye right ? patient: true true true true . therapist: so what can you do i drive sensor can be used ? patient: seen obviously my eye better be open i better be observant about what . i got my hand on the wheel . so i going to be feeling something so in hearing you know so sort of hearing therapist: do you have any kind of peacefulness ? patient: well it good idea wa wa in the mpr and sometimes that good sometimes that not good you know do necessarily call me down sometimes i can get so i should probably i could i can listen to some more soothing music . something that calm me down more also . therapist: yeah yeah . patient: yeah yeah i think the music might be more because not that i want to be distracted from the car . but i think my music might call me down more than having nothing you know like quiet and hearing the car growth might i can see that might make me nervous . i need to be aware of them . but i think i want to hear music . so i try that . yeah . therapist: yeah i focusing on the car in front of you patient: yeah . yeah . not necessarily one behind me that might hit me too much for that . so okay . okay now therapist: let think about when so what sensor . can we tap into ? patient: well when i looking at definitely i need to focus on because i reading something of course and i feeling my pin most of u on the computer . so i feeling the typewriter . typewriter keyboard so that a sense of touching thing . but i got to focus on and seen a paying attention to the word on the front of me . therapist: the hearing ? patient: i like to be quiet for just therapist: so not too much about the function of thing like when you have to type on the keyboard you know patient: okay . therapist: okay . so the next time when you try to tap into the census okay ? if you want to take just a five minute break and so for each sense that a one minute okay like before i start the test or before i start to drive or something okay okay to kind of do that . patient: okay . therapist: and also your statement . okay . patient: which i can do this . gussto okay i can do this . therapist: okay so when you will do this ? patient: well i got to drive home . so probably today when i drive home i could do that . a test i do really have a test till next week but when i drive all the time and so every day therapist: you know before we even we yeah so when you sitting ? patient: okay get ready and i call her in the parking lot . okay took that time take a few minute to go through all the sens . focus on that . put some soothing music on say i can do itand then proceed . therapist: okay . so that okay . patient: i try that . yeah . therapist: see how it go ? we talk about it . patient: okay . thanks . yeah sure . i take some practice . therapist: okay because the situation right now . patient: yeah . okay . therapist: do try to focus too much on . okay ?

            "therapist: afternoon . i glad you could get in today . patient: i still anxious . therapist: yes last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety . and according to my note you were going to look into some yoga class . you were going to attempt to drink le coffee . you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature . so i wondering how all that went ? patient: well i looked at the gym and there were really any yoga class so i did i did really do that . i did cut back on my coffee a little bit but i just find that it wake me up in the morning . so you know i cut back to one cup instead of two cup . and i did take the dog for a walk . but i have really gotten out other than that . therapist: okay so it sound like you made some movement forward towards your goal . you did at least look into yoga even though the gym did have yoga class . you did cut down from two cup of coffee to one . and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk . but it sound like you had a little bit of an issue . getting out more with people . patient: yeah i do . i do really like to go out with people . there usually a lot of a lot of chatter a lot of talking and it hard for me to be in . therapist: so it uncomfortable for you to be to around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how doe that make you feel ? patient: it just make me feel a little bit nervous . and then when i get out there i do really i do really engage in conversation . therapist: okay so actually getting out with people actually make you even more anxious . so i wondering what we could do about that . patient: i not really sure maybe i could invite people over instead . therapist: that would absolutely be one option . you could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you around . patient: yeah that a good idea . therapist: and in term of the yoga let get back to the yoga for a minute . tell me more about where you looked for yoga class . patient: well i just looked at my gym . i did really look anywhere else because i already paying to go to a gym and i do really want to pay extra to go somewhere else . so that why i did really look anywhere else . therapist: mm hmm . and so if i were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ? patient: maybe about a five or six . therapist: okay . patient: um well i i see all these picture in my newsfeed about yoga and i see all these picture and i just want to do it . so i interested in doing it it just really hard . therapist: so when you see the picture on your newsfeed it make you excited about doing it . but when you actually go to do it it make it more challenging . patient: well i have done it before . so it a little bit hard to get out there because i do think i a flexible other people ? therapist: mm hmm . and so you thinking that you not a flexible a the other people . i wondering if that what yoga is about flexibility ? patient: well i think i think that people go to become flexible . but i think that maybe some people are already just flexible . therapist: mm hmm . so you are concerned that maybe you might not be a flexible a the rest ? patient: yeah . therapist: and you be a beginner ? patient: well i worried i would be able to do the pose in class . therapist: okay . so what do you think would happen if you could do the pose in class ? patient: well i feel embarrassed i think . and then if the teacher tried to get me to do it and everybody else would see that they trying to get me into a pose and i think it would be embarrassing . therapist: okay . so you be embarrassed if you could do the certain policy . and how would you feel if you could do all the pose in the class patient: i think i feel really good . therapist: and so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the pose in the class ? patient: right ? i guess it just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it . therapist: what would what would cause you to not being able to do it ? patient: the cause are not we not sure . okay . therapist: i remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible . and i wondering what would make that difference between then and now ? patient: well when i wa a kid i used to just practice a stretch a lot and now that i do i do have the same flexibility . mm hmm . so a i gotten older i lost a lot of flexibility therapist: and how would it be if you could do all the pose in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed ? patient: i mean it would be okay . but i do i do like that feeling . therapist: what would be the payoff ? do you think ? if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment ? patient: well i probably feel really good in the end . therapist: you know i can give you i lot of study that i can give you and video that i can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down . a a matter of fact some study show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same a medication . so i not sure if you were if you knew that or not . patient: i did really know that . i just thought that that you go wa for about flexibility i did realize there were so many other benefit . therapist: okay . so how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ? patient: well i probably if i thought that i be it would make me le anxious i think i probably be around an eight or nine . therapist: good good . that a definite improvement . and and you could determine after that first class whether your anxiety level have decreased or not . and that would that be validation for you ? or would that be ? it give you even more motivation ? if your anxiety level were decreased instantly after the yoga class ? patient: i think that would be a lot of motivation to continue . therapist: okay . so one other thing that i wanted to to mention to you wa you said that you walk your dog in nature and curious a to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature . wow . patient: it wa only about minute . it wa really cold and windy . so we did want to stay out . and by we i mean the dog and i mm hmm . therapist: and so because of it it wa cold and windy . you decided to kind of cut the walk short . yeah . and and that definitely understandable . i wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day . patient: wow . it might help if i take a jacket next time . therapist: okay so if you took a jacket in case cold yeah . and do you have a special place in nature that make you feel peaceful that you could be in that would help you even more . enjoy it patient: a long a i just away from road noise and traffic and then it a lot better . okay and there lot of trail around my house like that . okay therapist: excellent . is it great that you have trail around your house where you not exposed to all that noise . patient: probably . therapist: and on a scale of one to tell me what that probably mean . patient: it probably attend . i can i can commit to that . therapist: okay . all right . so it sound like last week you had a few problem carrying out the assignment towards decreasing your anxiety . you really could find a yoga class because you already signed up for a gym that doe have the yoga class . but you already know about the yoga video that i sent you so you could actually do them at home . patient: yeah therapist: you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home ? patient: if i could do them at home i would probably do them all the time . mm hmm . i think that would be a big difference . therapist: and then there would be no embarrassment factor . if you could do the pose le coffee you gone from two cup to one cup that very good . and get out more with people you decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who going to be in your space . that always an apprehensive moment when you do know you have no control over who going to be in your space . and on a scale of one to you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog ? patient: i think it a . i think i can do them on all four all four . therapist: fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these item in your life next week of the course of next week ? how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel ? patient: perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these thing if i were doing them on a regular basis . mm hmm . therapist: and how would it make you feel ? patient: it would make me feel really good . therapist: and so you feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and i think you would do . patient: thank you so much .",
            "the patient feel anxious . the patient ha done yoga class cut back on coffee a bit to one cup and taken dog out for a walk . the patient doe not like chattering people so find hard to go out with people . one idea discussed wa to invite people over home . the patient explains they would feel embarassed if they are not able to do yoga pose . the therapist clarifies yoga reduces anxiety a lot and the patient readily agrees to it . the next idea wa to use jacket and take trail around the house that are le noisy for walking the dog . the therapist suggests to do yoga pose at home and that would be no embarassment . the patient confidently agrees they can do all of them on a regular basis ."

patient: i do really care . therapist: even still you think they would miss you ? patient: maybe i mean in their own way . they probably would have wished that they would have done different thing differently . yeah but that not my responsibility . therapist: what your responsibility right now ? patient: nothing . nothing . i mean therapist: so no one would correct me if i wrong . no one would care if you die . patient: i mean they probably care a little bit . do i care if they care ? no . therapist: so you care a little but you not concerned with that . and you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you lost a job . and now soon your house you have anything else that you care about ? any goal ? patient: i used to therapist: how about now ? patient: no . therapist: what happened to your goal ? patient: i drank them . i lost my job . i lost my house . but you know i wa thinking maybe i could find myself a new job but at this point i just so far gone like my life is so ruined i do know how you could expect me to come back from this i do know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like therapist: how to redeem yourself . patient: mm hmm therapist: you ca see what to do that now . patient: no . therapist: i mean come on . cuz cuz all thing that happened to overwhelmed you . patient: i do know . i mean happened to me did to myself . it just at this point . it like i lost so much have what i worked for . and i do have one scrap of dignity or anything at all . i do have anything . therapist: you do have anything you do have any worth . worthless . that how you feeling ? patient: yeah alone . worthless . yeah like nothing . there nothing redeemable . there nothing i can build upon . therapist: and have you been thinking about ending your life ? are you hesitant to tell me that ? patient: yes therapist: why is that ? patient: i guess a lot of reason . i know that we have worked together and i do want you to feel like you failed . i really do want you to try to do anything because i feel like nothing that you have tried ha worked . you know i a hopeless case . therapist: hmmm patient: and i feel like at this point it should even be your responsibility to try because it not fair to you anymore . and i do know . i just oh therapist: you planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ? patient: yeah . therapist: can you tell me about the plan ? patient: i do really want to talk about it . therapist: but you have a plan . you do want me to interfere in your plan ? patient: no no obviously not . therapist: but you aware that i going to try to interfere with your plan . patient: i get i guess so . therapist: you mentioned earlier that you just i mean it sound like you saying is you hit rock bottom and rock bottom ca be tolerated . and your family would care if they lost you but you indifferent to that . right ? i would care if you die . all right i gon na do everything i can to prevent that . it hard to see when you have thought or worthlessness . it hard to see stress . but i see somebody with strength . i see a young lady that over the last few month ha told me all kind of strength all kind of situation where you been resilient . you recall those conversation ? patient: i guess . therapist: but that not in the forefront of your mind right now . you strange but they still there . do you have an intent to commit suicide ? patient: yes therapist: and you do want me to stop here ? patient: yeah therapist: i going to stop you . right ? i want to i obligated to . and it really the best thing to be done is to prevent it . i know you feel this way now and i know i ca fully understand that . but i fairly sure that you wo feel this way . a week or two from now . right feeling of worthlessness feeling of hitting rock bottom they cycle just like all feeling . right ? you had ups and down before . remember ? patient: yes therapist: i see some of the long and productive life . suicide not it not the answer . i know it seems like the only option right now . i get that . but there still some other option . doe that make sense ? patient: yeah therapist: i know you probably do wan na hear about other option . i think what we should do today is get you over a an impatient alright ? and go pi keep you for day and kind of work on getting your mood stable . my guess is when you come out you feel differently on this subject . you feel a little better . maybe feel a little better place we can continue . and we will . i see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out . right . preferably on the same day . doe that make sense to you ? patient: i mean i guess . therapist: are you disappointed ? i trying to save your life . patient: yeah . therapist: do you understand why i doing it . patient: yeah . therapist: all right . so i gon na walk you over other counselor . i got ta make some phone call . we get you over there . okay . all right . patient: thanks .",

            "therapist: alisa how you doing today ? patient: good ? how are you ? therapist: i doing well . thanks for asking . therapist: how ha the anxiety been going ? patient: um since last session it seems to be in check . patient: nothing really major . it been going on with it . so i think patient: i getting to a point where it under control . therapist: i subsided a bit . that good . yeah that good . how thing been going at work lately ? patient: so work a little bit of a different story . um we have our daily meeting and i actually had to clean like one of my co worker aside because i feel like they undermine me all the time . and they like they do give me the respect basically that i deserve . so i took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it . and afterwards i mean the next day because we have these thing every day and she like she came back and came at me again . but it wa worse even after talking for patient: no . therapist: so you have these someone understands you have these daily meeting ? right . and you mentioned that she not showing you respect and that you deserve respect . right ? effect . so tell me tell me about that . believe from what we talked about abc before activating event and belief and consequence . in our abt tell me about that belief . patient: or i just feel that i do a good job and i deserve to be respected by my coworkers . yeah it just therapist: other level of respect . there a certain level of respect that you demand or need . patient: i do know if there a certain level but i feel just like i deserve it . you know therapist: and what did she do ? that kind of convinced you that she wa meeting that level of respect ? patient: well she wa like she doubt my idea um and just kind of made me feel like a fool basically . so i just i did understand . patient: right patient: i mean i guess . therapist: have you criticized other coworkers ? patient: yeah . therapist: so do you think that her criticism wa within normal limit like within the what you kind of seen there regularly patient: i mean now that you pointed out i mean i guess i can view it in that way that it wa . patient: it just felt like she wa purposely trying to nitpick if you were patient: yeah . patient: i mean i guess i may have gone out or a little partially um but i felt at the time that it wa reasonable therapist: at the time when you were ? patient: when i wa talking to her outside of the meeting . therapist: so you felt that she wa a bit harsh . you talk to her about it but then she become more harsh . so where do you stand with her now ? like the meeting ? well patient: i just been trying not to talk to her . and obviously in a work situation doe really help . therapist: it not convenient . yeah . it might not help . alright . so let work this through using the abc model that we use for the anxiety that you had before . right ? that wa troublesome to you before . what would the activating event be here in this situation ? patient: so i guess the confrontation i had whether therapist: wa this criticism ? patient: yeah . yeah . patient: so she criticized me and i felt disrespected . therapist: that a feeling patient: i feel or my my belief is that i deserve respect . patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah therapist: wa aggravation yeah . frustration frustration . so that that would be one of the consequence of how you processed her behavior . doe that make sense ? feeling the frustration feeling would be one of the consequence like an abc kind of chance you have the activating event . she criticizes you . your belief is that you deserve respect . and clearly she violated that belief . right ? she she did show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system . and one of the consequence therefore wa this feeling of frustration . were there any other consequence ? patient: well if we like go forward it the kind of disarray or the tension i guess you know in the office . therapist: to get that that definitely a consequence . i thinking there an intermediate consequence stuff . so you had that feeling of frustration . and what the next thing you did after that meeting wa over patient: like confronted her therapist: you confronted her ? right . so you have kind of those two consequence . and that confrontation it would appear ha led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticism which is another activating event . you could also think of a a consequence but like i said this is a cyclical . so you see how the a and the b and the c a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you . therapist: doe that make some some sense ? patient: it doe . yeah . and i mean when you put it that way and then you say it cyclical then you just i can see i can visualize that going around my carousel . therapist: sure exactly . so it help you to kind of see what caused what and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future . right . so we ca go back and change that but we can work on the future . so her criticism of you there no direct way to change that . consequence and consequence that leaf the belief system right which is the deserving respect right ? one of the thing we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking to more flexible thinking . therapist: so kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way . but you know i i demand and deserve respect right at this particular level and people are meeting it . right . would you say that a fair ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you like respect ? respect good . yeah . respect healthy and work environment certainly . but if you do get it you can still function . it tough for you . i can see that tough . tell me about that . patient: i mean i understand but you saying i get it ? i guess it just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on . it just getting there . therapist: mm hmm . do you are you willing to think of and challenge your belief in this instance ? patient: yes . therapist: yeah . tough though just a you mentioned like what the inside say tough how long have you had this belief cuz mentality of i deserve respect . patient: oh gosh um since i wa like a teenager . so long time therapist: this ha been a relatively persistent part of your life . let play system . so changing it going to be work . therapist: so if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking ? next time you in a meeting she still criticized you in the meeting . patient: yeah . therapist: so if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be i being disrespected again . i it probably come on that way . you kind of feel it . patient: yeah it it start in my stomach and then go all the way up . therapist: so it be your first physiological reaction right and emotional reaction . but if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking like i talked about right which is i like respect right . but i can survive and function without it . at some level i can accept that . i not going to get it all the time . other other area of life for you do get respect . patient: yeah . for my friend and my family i feel i feel like they give me . it actually mutual respect . they give me respect i give them respect and patient: well i think patient: over time if i learned to do that i first starting like within side of me like i would get that initial like patient: punched in the gut . patient: and i would have the urge to lash out at her . especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there that tension in our office . patient: i be able to do that i patient: think i be able to approach her and maybe ask her she want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of patient: talking with her . patient: maybe i misunderstood her in the first meeting . and she really did mean to undermine me a i said patient: and then go from there . therapist: so either way gathering the information meaning having a discussing discussion with her it would be helpful because i mean you may find that you really see thing so like and it wa just a disagreement in term of her criticism in the way you interpreted or she may have been trying to be critical and you know that to be really ca control someone else behavior . but it will give you an idea of maybe what our intention were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it function . patient: yeah . i certainly do want like our upper management to you know get involved and there be a bigger issue . therapist: you do want them to have to come and sort that out . right you can sort out their own . and that would be a good application of coping skill and flexible thinking . so is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week ? patient: i will definitely try . therapist: so really our plan move forward a a couple part . so one would be smooth thing over and sensitive discussing this with her letting her know you aware what going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be trying to move a little bit away from the rigid you know i deserve respect to i would like respect but i function adequately without respect from everyone . i know that tough . that gon na be that gon na be the challenge right ? but this will be this will give u good information and give you some practice . doe it all make sense to you ? patient: yeah it pretty clear . you explained it really well . thank you . therapist: so let work on those two those two element . right and next time you come in we check in on those two and make any needed modification to our strategy and we kind of move forward from there . patient: okay therapist: that sound good . patient: sound great . therapist: thanks lisa . patient: thanks .",
            "the patient ha been experiencing anxiety . the patient ha had trouble with one of their coworkers since they do respect the patient a deserved . the patient ha spoken about this to the coworker and it ha become worse after that . the patient feel the coworker criticism is more than the limit and they are harsh . the therapist run through the abc model with the patient . the therapist suggests to adopt flexible thinking to adapt to the situation . the patient agrees they could try to work thing out with the coworker over a cup of coffee in a calmer manner . the therapist explains the two element to try this week is to discus with the coworker and resolve it and secondly to function adequately without respect from everyone ."

            "therapist: how are you ? not well ? patient: no therapist: what going on . patient: well remember i had told you that they were downsizing at my job . therapist: i remember that . patient: so i you know been there year at my job . yeah . and they downsizing lately and they let me go . therapist: that terrible . i sorry to hear that . patient: no no no . so yeah it just you know they let me go . i have really nothing to go on . i do know what to do . i been at that . job so long . i really do know how to do anything else . therapist: you should talk about the job . you happy there . patient: yeah . i wa i thought you know i envision doing that job for a long time . so you know therapist: and that not gon na happen . no no . how doe this affect your financial outlook like your bill and such ? patient: oh it awful . i mean we definitely my husband and i it really spiraled out of control . my husband and i have kind of like joint we pay the bill together . and so this wa half of our income and that gone . and because it wa kind of more sudden we did really have time to do anything else you know time to prepare . therapist: so it definitely caught you off guard . do you have enough income with your husband job to cover your basic bill ? patient: were a little bit . yeah so far . but if i do find the job soon then i do know what gon na happen . i do know how bad it gon na get therapist: to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitment . patient: my husband usually deal with the bill so i not quite sure . but probably in another month or so it going to get really bad for about a month . therapist: what thought have you been having ? patient: all sort . i mean i i worried that you know like my husband and i are arguing because we under all this stress . i worry we gon na lose our house . you know i worried i going to be homeless . you know it embarrassing . i do have a job now . what if i do find another job ? you know what are my kid gon na do ? my kid are you know relying on u to meet their need . yeah yeah . so i mean we could be homeless . i might not ever get a job again you know i not getting any younger . so i just am afraid that i wo get another job . therapist: now you said you were laid off right ? patient: yeah . therapist: for the position . are you eligible for unemployment ? patient: i not sure i still looking into that . therapist: because if you i mean i not a labor law expert . but i think if you if you laid off there probably decent probability you could get on employment . how much for educational ? patient: i just have my bachelor . therapist: well that that more than most bachelor degree . yeah . you just have had to look for a job in a long time right here . because i guessing you thought you gon na retire . patient: yeah therapist: so this is upsetting for a lot of reason . so you have the financial stressor right ? i ca be minimized . the relational stressor mentioned it kind of embarrassing . yeah that more like an identity thing i see identify with what you did right now . you do a much because you not actively working in it . yeah . did you ever have any co worker who voluntarily left for other job ? patient: not that no . therapist: not at the time you worked there . patient: not that i wa aware of that . i think maybe it maybe like one a while ago but it wa a pretty good job . so . therapist: so a lot of people stay . patient: yeah . therapist: have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field ? who change job ? patient: yeah one of my friend wa in a similar field and he left the job and eventually found another job . you know how long it took . it took a while . it took a while . like maybe like two year or so at least almost yeah it wa a struggle for their family . so i think about that therapist: would you need to replace that full income to pay your bill or part of that income ? patient: i mean probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because you know we were comfortable the way we were living so far would be ideal but you know we could probably survive on on part of it it just not a well a we were living . therapist: so we talked about problem solving skill before in earlier session right . so have you applied a those concept to what going on now . patient: i mean i been trying to think of think of you know different opportunity that might be open to me now and you know being able to spend more time with my kid and thing like that . i been trying to think of it other way my situation . therapist: so there sort of an upside and then sense the time part at some point need to replace the income . yeah that very pragmatic in the money . have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job to work out you could look at part time job . patient: i thought about it but i really having a hard time with it . therapist: what would it what would it mean about you ? what would it say about you if you had to take a part time job so finding another full time job is so much of the loss ? patient: what would it mean about me is that i think if i only had a part time job that i wa qualified that i wa good enough for full time . therapist: so you would you would internalize that and meaning would be that you not a valuable . patient: yeah . therapist: so it speaks to self worth . patient: well right now it not good . well i mean i been arguing with my husband i been drinking a lot more you know the depression ha come back a lot worse . so it just starting to become the cycle where you know drinking and getting into argument and situation not getting better and it just keep snowballing keep snowballing . therapist: yeah . and these these behavior are all thing that potentially could impede your goal . so it is kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy element to this . yeah . do you agonize you worry invest in these thought ? right ? and then to temporarily take away the pain you drink ? yeah . that end up being more dysfunction right with a relationship with your husband . yeah . imagine if you intoxicated you not looking for new work . yeah . that would be ideal timing . so in a sense you you not helping thing to improve . and it all kind of start without thinking patient: but it hard when i really depressed and the situation not getting better . and i just home sitting about you know drinking while everyone else is carrying on with their life and i stuck here . therapist: and that tie into that kind of worthless type five . so you fulfilling that role . worthless . that sound manifesting for you . and that one thing you can do . that an option you can drink and you could have relational struggle . but is that really ? is that really what you want at all ? is that the most useful ? patient: really ? no it not helping . therapist: how do you think you could break that cycle ? patient: i been thinking about you know trying to get more organized like we talked about before with the finance and and trying to you know figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want what to do and maybe by baby step so it not like so overwhelming for me like the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family . and like breaking it down . therapist: well that make sense . yeah so the first step would be figuring out what the minimum amount you really need right ? so you shoot for hire full time but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which i want free time to decline . right ? so it make sense . so armed with that information and you could go into the workplace right ? and it wa le anxiety kind of just know this job gon na if i get it that good right lord i might a well not apply to this one because it not gon na work . so a efficient a time say it good . that sound logical . patient: i think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown like worry about what if this never happens for me ? you know what if i do get a job ? you know what if we lose our house ? therapist: that worry yeah no worry . nagging yeah . yeah . so patient: i mean worst case if we do get a job i mean probably . i do know like get a smaller house or find a way around it . i mean she would need to have some tough time . therapist: yeah . it would be difficult right ? to be fair right ? it would be difficult but you would adapt . patient: right ? so like it would be difficult but i think if i really thought about it you know we would probably get through it . therapist: so if we pick up with that we say that really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive response to automatic thought right ? so if you telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety craving to drink you tell yourself well the worst that could happen is i do work the rest of my life again acknowledging that pretty unlikely . but the worst thing to happen is i wo work again . and i might have to adapt i might have to have a simpler life in term of material good and small house but i would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood or your thought ? patient: i mean i think when i really think about it you know like you said i think i le depressed or think that i you know i more able to cope with it . you know knowing okay well this is the worst that could happen but maybe it not a bad a i thought . would be embed . therapist: so there a piece that come with clarity that come with accepting what the worst case scenario could be . right ? and probably another part of the adaptive response could be you know i could live to the worst case scenario . i think it important to acknowledge that it unlikely . that unlikely . right ? so statistic probability is on your side here . right ? so a you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment you probably have some some interview we do get a job offer right . but eventually if i have one where you do yeah right . it it just math . right ? if you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption reduce that depression anxiety . patient: yeah . therapist: so let end there for today . but i want you to try for the next week . i want to try plan that adaptive response right ? actually there two we talking about right ? one is you could survive the worst case scenario . and the other one is that probabilistically it wo happen . right ? so you have kind of two . well you do have two adaptive response i want you to apply when those automatic thought come up like i never gon na work again . okay this is a catastrophe . so like that self talk . yeah apply that self talk . so identify that automatic thought because we talked about that skill right ? and then apply that self talk right away . all right and let see you have the thought record . right . so when that you know when you can fill one of those out okay when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response even if you ca get it completely filled out i understand that . i know there a lot on there . just what you can get done on that . anything you can do . that would be helpful . patient: okay . therapist: sound good ? patient: yeah therapist: so scheduled for one week . so i see you then we see how this go to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety . patient: okay thanks",
            "the patient ha been at their job for year and they let the patient go due to downsizing . the patient is worried if they will be able to manage the bill in a month or so with just husband income . the therapist asks the patient to apply problem solving skill discussed before . the patient doubt their self worth if they will manage a part time job even . the patient ha been drinking and getting into fight with their husband since losing the job . the patient ha been depressed . the patient feel if they can calculate the minimum amount needed to manage their finance and the look for a job according to that it will be a good solution . the therapist asks the patient to practice adaptive response and give self talk that probabilistically worst case scenario wo happen for the automatic thought . seoncdly the therapist asks to thought record what is being done . the patient ha been asked to try it this week ."

patient: yeah because i created this prototype in my room . and anytime i basically in there i wa it wa good . i had energy . i did have everything that i wanted . but my prototype wa running out of fuel . and so i needed to make it bigger larger so it can run longer . therapist: that what you trying to do patient: yeah that what i wa trying to do when i would borrowed the tool from my neighbor but yeah and then also i wa ordering some thing that were online . and they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that i wa creating that i use the tool for my neighbor house . it could have been all perfect and set so that when all of the hard drive in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in i could just plug it in . and then not only my room covered but also my house covered and all of my family they could just be happy . therapist: they could be happy they could be happy like you know you were happy . patient: i wa happy like so two week ago i wa i wa good . i i wa up i did all the calculation that i need to create . so i can actually build my base in my system . but then i also did the calculation about the different type of wave being in the house but then also out of the house that i also had the opportunity to just not sleep because i need sleep . i wa tired . and if i did sleep i slept for like minute just because i needed to finish what i wa going to do . and i wa so close to finishing and my neighbour called cop . therapist: so you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you were really sleeping much patient: doe everybody do that ? therapist: you also happy and felt energetic patient: i felt good . like when i when i sleep i do like when i sleep because it just feel wrong . therapist: and how do you feel now in comparison ? patient: i alright guy . all right . just all right right now . the government maybe get on different medication . so just all right . therapist: so not happy or sad . patient: not sad either . it just you in the middle therapist: do you want to get back to that happiness patient: of course who doe want to get back to the happiness of their life . that the reason why you need to finish machine therapist: yeah . you mentioned you ordered some product online . how much did you order ? patient: um i think i ordered probably know the exact number i ordered hard drive because is the perfect number that i needed to not only cover my bedroom so i can always be happy and if the system went down my room wa always going to be covered . but then within that it also covered my house so that my family could be happy and like my four neighbor around u so we can all be happy . and that the reason why i kind of angry at my one neighbor because i wa including his house in all by my grid so that he can also be happy all the time . therapist: he would have been affected by a machine . patient: of course he the helping hand . he helped me out . he let me borrow his tool . but evidently he did let me borrow him this time . so just pull him out . have another neighbor take his place . therapist: were all those hard drive fairly expensive ? patient: i do know . when i wa up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment . i found my mom purse and i wa just like oh my god she ha a credit card in there . oh my god i can use our credit card . so i wa using our credit card because it trying to make her happy . and so i do know i added the . they were probably to apiece depending on where it could get them and i just ordered them . therapist: how your mother respond to that ? patient: my mom came to the hospital and wa like where are all these box coming from ? it like this but i in my room . and she put them into my room . and then like a week ago she ha like i see my credit card and she want to happen . therapist: is that strange relationship ? patient: no that just how we have a relationship generally therapist: you get along okay . patient: we get along perfectly fine . like that that how we talk to each other . like we talk to each other minimally because she not in my room so she not happy . so anytime she doe come into my room it mess up the balance . so i get unhappy and then i just tell her to stay out so that i can be happy and she can be happy in her own place . therapist: and you mentioned that they changed medication in the hospital . patient: the government changed for medication therapist: how are you feeling about taking your medication ? patient: while so therapist: right you you really want to get back to work on that machine . patient: yes i want to be back in my happy place . therapist: have you found yourself a motivated these last couple week a you were before you hospitalized ? patient: now ? i have been that motivated . big . i know i going to get it done . it just i just do know if i gon na get it done today or tomorrow but i know what gon na get done . therapist: you still want to get that done . it important to know . patient: it really important because i ca be controlled by the government anymore . therapist: by jason i like you to continue seeing a counselor here . if you found the counsellor to be helpful . patient: the counselor ha been okay . therapist: but that okay it been okay . but we continue to counseling and hope that can can help you a bit . i appreciate you spending this time with me and explain what happened . patient: thank you .",
            "the patient wa building a machine in their room so that government can not hear their thought action or behavior . the cop came and took the patient to the hospital . the patient feel they are creating order for everyone to follow and the patient is not a follower . the patient ha ordered tool online and borrowed from neighbor to secure their entire house . the patient ha been restless and doe not sleep much feel very good and energetic . the patient neither feel happy nor sad somewhere in the middle . the patient had ordered hard drive to form a grid to protect theirs and their neighbor home . it wa bought with mom credit card at to a piece . the patient and their mom interact minimally and that is normal according to the patient . the patient feel they have to complete the machine . the patient is paranoid about the government and do not wish to be controlled by them . the therapist request the patient to continue seeing a counselor ."

what did you do once those are kind of begun ? patient: well having not had to deal with my illness throughout university and for it not being a part of that world i i did confront those symptom in a in a way that gon na have long term stability . and a well it began with doing the work that i needed to do . that just that just what i needed to do in order to achieve my goal and to achieve what i want to . and then it just i just let it take hold . and i it wa all part of it wa it wa yeah it wa the illness it wa me it wa just i wa in i wa the master of this whole situation and i wa everything that wa happening wa down to my own doing . therapist: so it sound is on the one hand you did confront it you kind of just let it roll . and on the other hand you said that you kind of took it a evidence that you were very energetic you were powerful . this wa all kind of explained about who you were . and i guess how did that affect you looking at thing in that way ? patient: it just it wa my time . it all been leading to like this wa the moment where i would sort of like become the person that i want it to be . all the hard work all everything while the work that my parent had done for me and all the work that i had been doing . it wa now crystallizing therapist: for you on the brink of something yeah mess from the sound of it . and again going back to that kind of beginning ah where you started to stay up late and use stimulant . i mean how much sleep were you getting at the beginning ? patient: they saw it gradually diminished . i think it began at six five . and wa ended up about three and two . therapist: and what kind of thing did you notice ? did you notice any change from having le and le sleep in your body maybe the way you were thinking . patient: think the harder i wa working the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder i work the more i would do . so it wa it wa . it wa just a yeah the momentum wa building more than anything . my thought were firing and my goal wa stronger in my yeah my determination wa therapist: and how did you feel in your body ? did you notice any change physically ? patient: no i could recall the time maybe i wa trying to get my way i wa avoiding avoiding confronting any negative effect but nothing powerful come on . therapist: okay . i want you to kind of thing were a bit further along after your exam . he said you going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app . wa there anything else that you did that maybe you would normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat wa much higher than you like it to be ? patient: there wa i hide a lot of saving . that my my parent had built up for me which i probabiliy do really exist anymore either through the money invested and through drug clothes . i had a girlfriend at the time but because it wa because i wa the main character and in a sense it always wa only the only person that matter and so sort of those around me especially still did really have a much importance . so on night out i would . she just would be in my mind and so that would be other woman . therapist: okay patient: so therapist: how do you feel about that now looking back on it ? patient: i think it it those moment where it not just me . it those those closest to you and those around you that have to suffer the more than anyone else that brings a lot of the shame",
            "the patient had final exam approaching and they had to put more effort . this increased their stress level and they started taking ritalin . the patient felt increased confidence worked a lot harder and were a lot productive but they did not secure the grade they wished to . the patient wa in control of themselves for three year . the patient got too involved with substance abuse like cocaine after finishing exam and before result . the patient ha been using their parent saving and got a credit card too to spend on drug . the patient feel at the brink of succeeding from their hard work and they seem to have fallen trap to the stimulant . the patient had just been getting two to three hour of sleep . the patient ha also not given importance to their girlfriend . the patient feel they were not themselves and people closest to them have been most affected ."

patient: mm hmm . therapist: later in the day are we thinking about the cutting ? patient: well i kind of forgot about it . therapist: okay . patient: but then i just started thinking about it again right before bad and just feeling really guilty that i cut . because i knew i wa going to have to talk about it with you . and i just i mean i the night time i just i constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like i mean you know it usually a pretty hard time . therapist: i know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night . yeah . so you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty ? patient: yeah . therapist: sound like you were feeling so good about it then a you were in the afternoon . patient: no . that always seems to happen . therapist: sound like for you cutting work for a little while but it doe last ? patient: yeah i guess so . therapist: i knew you also been working on doing le cutting . patient: i been doing pretty good therapist: you have you been working really hard . i just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you wo have those guilty feeling ?

patient: yeah . that right . therapist: so i wondering if that point if we can think of two thing that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting . patient: okay therapist: that bring that anger from a nine down a little bit . patient: it not going to bring it down all the way to a three though . i tell you that much . therapist: it might not . but it bring it down a little bit . maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more . patient: all right therapist: maybe there be thing will feel good about later . you wo have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back . patient: all right . therapist: so the first thing is that pencil it sound like it comforting to have it . patient: yeah it is . therapist: it also sound like it tempting what do you think about that ? patient: i mean only if i am in the mood to cut it tempting therapist: having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other thing . when you been talking about how you really committed to not cutting any more or cutting le patient: yeah i am . therapist: sound like that pencil standing in your way . patient: yeah maybe . therapist: what do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you ca cut with . patient: i mean maybe only only if it can be like a really cool pencil therapist: that way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which wo tempt you . that make it easier to try the two thing . patient: yeah . therapist: okay what do you think our first thing should be ? what do you think you can try ? you just heard somebody say something you do want to hear you feeling pretty angry . what can you do in that moment ? patient: oh what i do a lot at home when my mom bothering me and saying stuff i do want to hear i put my headphone on . therapist: do you have your headphone with you at school ? patient: yeah they they they actually they let me keep them on in school . therapist: is that something you be willing to try next time ? patient: i think so . there a there a few song that usually helped me so i think so . therapist: okay that sound like a good one to try . so we have headphone we need to come up with one more . what do you think you like to try ? patient: well i really like my teacher mr . xion . so she seems to always kind of be there when i need to talk . and her room kind of right down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway . so i guess i could talk to her . therapist: that sound like a good option . that our goal is to keep pushing cutting further down the list and keep adding thing that you going to try first . and you right that the first thing you try it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three but it might bring you down a little bit . and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more . so you have to be willing to try a few thing . can you do that ? patient: i can but i really want like a cooler pencil though like like a cooler pencil so i do know maybe maybe we could go look for a pencil together . therapist: i think that a good idea . patient: okay i like that . therapist: okay . thank you for answering all my question on this . you did a great job with this chain and i know it wa easy . patient: yeah . you welcome . therapist: let go look for a pencil .",

patient: that sound fine . yes doctor . therapist: great . so should we have a look at your blood test ? yes . yeah . here it is . so what we testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood right and just to show you the normal range for woman is between . and gram per deciliter of hemoglobin right ? and this is your level of hemoglobin . it . . patient: all that slows . therapist: it a bit lower than we would like . so what we looking to do is to get that back within the normal range right . just to reassure you iron deficiency anemia which i think you got is fairly common up to around of woman can experience this type of anemia . patient: right . therapist: and it very treatable a well . yeah . patient: yeah . oh yes . i mean this tightness so it just just getting me down doctor . therapist: i must be because you got quite a busy lifestyle . patient: yes yeah . and i just ca cope with it . therapist: okay . yeah . shall i tell you a bit more about anemia ? do you know anything about the condition ? patient: i do know . i mean i heard of it but i do know what it is . therapist: it is the condition relates to your blood right . within your blood there several component one of which is plasma . within the plasma you have your red blood cell . and within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carry the oxygen around your body to all the different organ . okay ? now if that not working efficiently you start to experience the kind of symptom that you been having like breathlessness . dizziness tiredness . patient: yeah definitely . yes . therapist: one of the cause can be blood loss . so i wondered about your period . how are they ? patient: well they been heavy these last few month really heavier . i pas it down to my age you know this stuff getting irregular and heavy . and but you might be right . therapist: yeah that may be a fact . yeah . yeah . so i want to talk to you about treatment . now . there are a couple of thing that i would suggest that you try . the first thing we like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet . can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment ? patient: so i mean i really busy and i think they have a reasonable you know well balanced diet . we eat a lot of ready meal . and then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it wa cooked bacon bowtie so so i think it quite good diet rightyes therapist: teenage child they keep you busy . patient: oh they do . yes . i mean you know it like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired . i just getting tired therapist: it must be hard for you to do all those thing . patient: yes . yeah it difficult . i just feel yourself ca cope anymore . therapist: yeah . now you mentioned ready meal . i can understand you relying on those for convenience . but the problem is sometimes you do get the proper balance of nutrient . patient: all right doctor therapist: so what i ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich food in your diet . patient: oh right . okay . therapist: before i tell you about what some of those food are can ask if you a vegetarian . patient: no no therapist: you know the reason i asked that is because one of the best source of iron in your diet is lean red meat . patient: oh yes . yeah you nice day . therapist: yeah exactly . also liver is a good source of iron . patient: no no no no could eat liver . therapist: what about something like steak that you mentioned ? would you consider eating that a bit more regularly ? patient: well yes . i mean state one day to kaku toll you know because now to go good . yes . yeah . therapist: there also leafy green vegetable thing like kale and spinach a good source of iron . patient: ohh the kid would eat that . but i mean they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and i could go for the leafy green vegetable . broccoli so there broccoli ? therapist: yes . yeah i like broccoli . you know patient: ohh good good i would go with that . therapist: there other thing too . you might want to consider thing like fortified cereal which have iron . and patient: what are those ? therapist: well if you look on the ingredient panel cereal you see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those . patient: oh yes yes ill look in the supermarket . i mean i got some of those . we could have a tweak and and that give me more time to cook or die therapist: could make your life a bit easier . patient: yeah definitely i would be happy to vote yes therapist: white bread is a good source of iron a well . patient: yes . yeah . no they only like white bread only buy white bread but i could buy myself some brown bread . cob and have it for lunch . yes . yeah . no good . therapist: so do you think you could give some of those thing a try ? patient: yeah . i would try doctor definitely therapist: right . yeah it the other thing i like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablet . patient: oh i not into tablet . why ? therapist: okay . this can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia . and what it doe is it supplement the amount of iron and iron you getting in your diet . patient: so will that be short term therapist: yes yes . often people respond very well to those . you can have some side effect . sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on you know on an empty stomach . so do you take them after a meal ? patient: all right you how to remember to do that ? yes . yeah . therapist: i think those two thing adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablet i think he might respond very well to treatment . patient: yes . yeah . have a go . doctor therapist: how do you feel about the information i given you so far outside ? patient: yes i definitely try if it make me feel any better . it worth it . therapist: yes . excellent . yeah excellent . i given you quite a lot of information about anemia today . i got a leaflet here about anemia which i thought you might like to take home and read in your own time . patient: ohh thank you . yes yeah . oh yes . yeah i read this talk . this is sometimes difficult to remember what what your tell so yes having a look at this at home would be really helpful . therapist: that right . patient: yes . therapist: that right . so just to check that i explained thing to you correctly that you could just recap on the the two treatment that you going to try patient: what you said that the navy wa due to a lack of iron and i can get this from having some red meat i mean steak lamb chop would that be ? therapist: yeah . patient: yeah . and green vegetable and wholemeal bread and have these iron tablet and you know hopefully i feel better . thank you . therapist: yes excellent . so what i like you to do is come back in a couple of week and then we can see how you doing . patient: yeah . therapist: have you got any question ? patient: are there any other test i have to have ? therapist: i think at this stage when you come back to see me again we do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level than if you have if it ha gone back into the normal range . it might be then that we look at doing some other investigation . but i do want to worry about that . at this stage . i think let see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablet . and we can discus that next time . patient: all right thank you . yes . therapist: is there anything else ? patient: no i think that it . thank you . therapist: okay . well good to see you . and i see you again in a few week . patient: okay . thank you . therapist: bye patient: bye .",
