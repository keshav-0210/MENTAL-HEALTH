            "therapist: corleto how you doing today \\s patient: good \\s therapist: i do well thanks for asking howd you do this week \\s patient: better \\s patient: well last time we talked about that \\s therapist: postponed gratification yeah \\s patient: that um i think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off 10 minutes yeah so \\s patient: i did better \\s patient: i think i ended up only doing like join half instead of two i was able to put offered i think 10 minutes couple times then there were there was i think one or two days where i went out for walk because i was tired of staring at clock waiting for 10 minutes to pass so i got up went for walk then i passed one of my friends so i ended up walking with her i actually didnt get back to my house for like an hour so i kind of put it off for like an hour because then i came home took couple hits on \\s therapist: so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least in most cases it was rough \\s patient: it was rough yeah \\s therapist: so it was it was difficult for you but most cases youre able to pull off 10 minutes mm hmm that sounds like theres few instances where youre able to hold it off longer because something else kind of yeah came up \\s patient: yeah i found i actually talked to couple people on phone before i knew it like half hour to come by \\s therapist: so another activity presented itself youve forgotten with marijuana \\s patient: kind of yeah yeah i guess i just wasnt thinking about it \\s therapist: so have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked \\s patient: no not really \\s therapist: tell me about that \\s patient: i mean its i dont see it as problem its its legal in lot of states now i mean its not that bad for you it doesnt really endanger me much \\s therapist: so you still you still believe you should have right to smoke marijuana \\s patient: yeah i mean im not hurting anybody else \\s therapist: but at same time you want to go back to work if i remember right youre person that you could go work for i guess you know them right yeah its my uncle your uncle you need to be cleaned for was about two months \\s patient: yeah two to three months \\s therapist: so \\s therapist: you have kind of opposing forces here right you have your enjoyment of marijuana then you you know thats something you like you dont wanna give up you believe you have right to do that but then theres that job \\s patient: yeah i mean my parents are pretty cool with it like they know but i mean im at point now where they kind of want me to move on move out but i dont know i mean i just itd be nice to have that job like its really good job but at same time like i dont see why i have to sacrifice something that i like \\s therapist: so it doesnt seem fair to you but she recognizes reality of your situation \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment \\s patient: yeah its pretty accurate \\s therapist: so youre not happy about that choice \\s therapist: kind of what we did with postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes you were able to do that more although its difficult \\s patient: its difficult \\s therapist: its difficult for you \\s therapist: so \\s therapist: i asked you to track number of times you smoke marijuana did you really track that over last week \\s therapist: yeah you remember how many times that was \\s patient: i think \\s patient: think i \\s patient: think it like 15 okay between 15 20 \\s therapist: between 15 20 how many times did something kind of get in way thats something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed \\s patient: im like \\s patient: almost closer to 20 times i guess otherwise i probably would have kept going smoke more i mean there were couple times where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me that kind of distracted me so i was able to put it off for little bit \\s therapist: so you can see in that 10 minutes things can happen right things can happen that can help you to avoid marijuana sometimes nothing does after 10 minutes use it sometimes something does kind of get in way with marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy then you didnt use \\s therapist: so with that in mind \\s therapist: you found experience rough but was it tolerable \\s patient: yeah was it bad \\s therapist: was bit do you think for this next week we could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes \\s patient: i dont know that seems kinda yeah that seems like longer time \\s therapist: that that definitely that longer time \\s patient: i dont know about that \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: maybe like 15 minutes \\s therapist: no compromises 15 okay do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15 \\s patient: i think i could try little bit more than 20 \\s therapist: all right so lets go with 15 minutes right so 15 minutes you know as compared to 10 ill give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you you wouldnt use that instance right theres also you know to constructively use that time you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right you could use that time start walking yeah anything else that that you like maybe in past on occasion when you want to use marijuana but she didnt have anything available what would you do instead \\s patient: binge watch tv \\s therapist: or should it be okay well so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer youre delaying using marijuana you could start watching show \\s patient: yeah i can do that \\s therapist: at under 15 minutes you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching show so do you see kind of how it works like it making sense to you postponing \\s patient: yeah it doesnt make it any easier but its tough for you yeah yeah no i definitely see how helps \\s therapist: maybe if were successful to 15 \\s therapist: who knows well move it up from there \\s patient: maybe well see how 15 goes see \\s therapist: how it goes 15 yeah ill see how that goes you know im hoping i hope this kind of makes sense that therell be point where you will be really interfering with vast majority of times that use marijuana like because youre giving yourself that many more opportunities longer you wait right more minutes you wait more opportunities for something else to get in way so to speak probably what youll see just like you saw this last because youre you know you used marijuana less frequently just by waiting 10 minutes even though you described as difficult im sure it was but there were few times where it kind of worked out \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so i think that planning something for that time would be helpful try to plan something 15 minutes even if you fully intend to beyond 15 to go right use i think its still useful plan something in there you never know that might take you or you might end up walking or watching tv or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from marijuana use okay so thats like plan \\s patient: yeah i think i can give that try \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: sounds like plan \\s patient: yeah i think we can manage that \\s therapist: all right well go with that ill see you next week okay thank you",
            "Last week, postponed gratification was discussed with the patient. The patient has successfully been able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least in most cases roughly. There has been instances where patient even forgot marijuana. The patient feels the same towards marijuana since last session since it is legal in many states and does not hurt anybody else. However, the patient has a nice job at uncle's for which they need to be clean for two to three months.  The patient does not see why to sacrifice this for a job. The patient is requested if they can postpone gratification from 10 to 15 minutes. The patient is suggested if they can watch a show to use up time. The therapist clarifies that the patient is giving many more opportunities to interfere by longer they wait. The therapist will see the patient next week. "

            "The patient was feeling angry that the therapy wasn't getting them anywhere. The patient was anxious to share that they are angry at the therapist since it is not something they usually say. The therapist clarifies that the patient is concerned if the therapist would feel like they are blaming them. The patient further adds that they feel alone in this therapy. But they feel better now that they have shared everything, it helps them."

            "therapist: hey carla how are you \\s patient: it good how are you \\s therapist: im doing well thanks for asking \\s therapist: whats been going on this last week \\s patient: um \\s patient: ive just been feeling like kind of in rut i mean ive been looking for job hadnt really gotten anywhere then \\s patient: i had drink other night i just felt like \\s patient: that like me not having job going out having that drink like i just it wasnt deserved i just felt like such loser because i should have that was time that i should have been at work if i had job instead i was at bar drinking so i had one drink then ellen two do another because then i just felt worse i figured i had one so come on \\s therapist: so how much should you drink in total \\s patient: i think i lost track after four or five \\s therapist: but how long had it been since you had drink before that \\s patient: i did really well i it was i think like three weeks \\s therapist: three weeks or so she did really well then you had you had one drink that just made you feel like you werent successful \\s patient: i felt like loser \\s patient: felt like loser \\s therapist: you feel that kind of led to drinking some more so you had rough time with things \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: what now \\s patient: i mean now i just kind of i dont im afraid to go back like im afraid to go out with like some friends they invite me out to dinner but i know theres alcohol \\s therapist: that where you were when that first strike was out with friends \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so theres few things going on \\s therapist: weve talked in past right about separating behavior from person right so behavior what we do not who we are you remember those discussions correct me if im wrong with sounds like im using different words than you use but it sounds like when you had that first drink youre kind of ashamed that you had drink you had it during time when you would have been working \\s patient: yeah thats pretty accurate \\s therapist: thats pretty accurate all right so taking yourself kind of back to that moment all right we we had that first that first drink like you finished that first drank \\s therapist: what was your what was your thought at that at that moment \\s patient: just like shameful like i did really really well then here i was i just finished drink i knew i wanted another one \\s therapist: okay so shameful kind of like feeling but thought i did really really well right \\s therapist: so thats what your thinking was i did really really well \\s therapist: what was that end of thought or was that was there more before you had that next trick \\s patient: i guess just i was doing well then i had drink i just felt like an awful person so i figured what was hurt having more \\s therapist: sort of sequence would have been you had to drink you felt shameful at same time youre thinking that you were doing really well then just really as you said before you just felt like loser then you decided might as well just have second drink so another thought might be that like i might just have second drink \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: yeah so you can see others some thoughts some feelings at work right as you finish that first drink was fairly quick but those thoughts feelings fairly occur fairly quickly after drink \\s patient: yeah absolutely as i was finishing then finished \\s therapist: so right away you regret it that regret as you thought about it \\s therapist: dont might as well just just continue drinking now because you kind of blew it \\s patient: i already messed up i might as well keep going \\s therapist: okay \\s therapist: thats common cycle to fall into you had three weeks we hadnt had drink prior to that so lets lets look at this lets try to separate behavior from self little bit if you had if you had friend who was in same predicament right you had history of using alcohol then at three weeks without any alcohol use then their behavior was to have drink what would you think of them \\s patient: i think that they had rough day or something was to happen where \\s patient: i mean its just wondering \\s therapist: i had rough day one drink what would you think of their behavior how would you categorize that behavior \\s patient: thats just they made mistake \\s therapist: so not ideal \\s therapist: depending on their point of view maybe little irresponsible \\s patient: yeah i think irresponsible \\s therapist: irresponsible but you wouldnt necessarily characterize them as bad person \\s patient: no \\s therapist: but their behavior was bit of responsible \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you know in terms of like recovery plan which would be to not drink \\s therapist: but when you apply that same example examination to your own situation how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink \\s patient: it was my mistake it was in it it makes me worse person for doing it \\s therapist: so you see how youre youre being little bit quite bit rougher on yourself like your your evaluation of yourself fairly harsh you mentioned loser earlier ashamed \\s therapist: whereas you wouldnt necessarily evaluate someone else that way \\s therapist: how would you evaluate your behavior how would you how would you judge your behavior taking that first drink \\s patient: shameful i mean irresponsible which bad overall \\s therapist: so so bad irresponsible shameful \\s therapist: there way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking way you evaluate it from yourself like are you into behavior \\s therapist: together meshed or can you be separated \\s patient: i think we could be separated but it it feels like were like i am that behavior \\s therapist: in that moment its very congruent for you \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: shame matches behavior to behavior matches shame like its there one at that moment mm hmm but really logically rationally youre you ryan your identity values your behavior something you do \\s therapist: but in moment its hard for you to see that \\s therapist: mm hmm looking back on it now are you able to see distinction between what people do what they are \\s patient: yeah i mean just because you have one drink doesnt make you horrible person \\s therapist: no certainly not you were you were clean for three weeks you had one drink so really your behavior was slip \\s therapist: right it was irresponsible in relationship to your goals i suppose but still slip you could have stopped but that shame got ahold of you right i thought well now ive done it i blew it yeah so with that mentality you kind of set yourself up for drinking more so i think this important because weve seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety then well drink bit then have weeks as writing im wondering if part of difficulty youre facing youre not coping with slips as just slips \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: youre allowing them to be gateways into lot more drinking than slip does that make sense that thats pretty accurate \\s therapist: you see how shameful feelings kind of just interfere with behavior that you really want thats really consistent with their goals which would be to not continue drinking \\s patient: mm hmm \\s therapist: another piece of this too association associating with friends who drink youre putting yourself in treacherous situation again thats behavior \\s therapist: right that doesnt make you one way or other its behavior how would you judge that behavior going out with friends \\s patient: i dont know i mean difficult because i like being around those people but i guess it would be its risky \\s therapist: risky okay its risky behavior what does it make you who are you because you do that behavior like how do you feel about yourself when you take that risky behavior \\s patient: guilty \\s therapist: okay \\s therapist: so you have guilt when you go out with your friends then you have shame if you drink both in this case both emotions that kind of point you in direction of more drinking so part of this behavioral strategy here to avoid circumstances like to recognize thats risky behavior which you have other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away right does that does that separation of what we do who we are makes sense to rationally \\s patient: kind of \\s therapist: feels little unnatural though \\s patient: yeah \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so maybe as youre confronting \\s therapist: similar situations in course of next week you could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk try to try to separate your identity from that behavior so so just judge behavior okay right dont dont pass any judgment on yourself \\s therapist: so that makes sense \\s patient: kind of yeah \\s therapist: it might help you to \\s therapist: since its little tough to because right now feeling judgment retro twined right it might help to write down when these things happen kind of write down like like one row for this how i judge this behavior but im thinking about doing this how i judge myself so if you see lot of self judgment that might be clue that youre falling into cycle little bit \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: where youre making decisions based on that emotion instead of rational judgment behavior \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: that helped little bit \\s patient: yeah i think that would probably be beneficial \\s therapist: so thatll be our plan going forward \\s therapist: until next week note document your judgment about your behavior any judgment you may have about yourself right theres some insight that can be gained there right kind of distinguish two making those try to use that evidence before making decision to might put you in risky spot \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: sound like plan \\s patient: yeah i think i can try that \\s therapist: okay good ill see you next week well see how you did with those goals \\s patient: okay",

            "therapist: alright so lets see if we could lets rank those two things right so one everyones judging me how i was other poor grade which one larger fear for you \\s patient: i would say maybe like judging \\s therapist: okay so grades concern \\s patient: yeah but i figured i could do better on subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you i feel like that doesnt go away as quickly \\s therapist: what would it mean if they they thought you were anxious during that presentation \\s patient: i guess i worried that they would think im anxious because i dont know what im doing or i dont belong there \\s therapist: so if they notice your anxiety then they think you dont belong in that level \\s patient: yeah like i dont deserve to be in that program \\s therapist: if they dont recognize those symptoms they wouldnt think that do they \\s patient: they might write that maybe they think thats why im anxious or thats why im not doing well \\s therapist: well how do you feel about your abilities status in programming room \\s patient: i think you know typically im one of top students in my program ive seen two get concepts pretty well its just when i have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via like presentation or something that im worried that you know maybe im an imposter or something but so i start to question myself but i think in general that you know im pretty good student before this im doing pretty well in program \\s therapist: so youre good student you recognize that you have this one area where you dont feel like you do great job thats presentations in terms of grade you really only had one bad presentation but grades aside youre anxious youre worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them \\s patient: yeah exactly \\s therapist: okay so if they thought you were us were imposter so if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they actually believe because of whats been happening what would that mean what would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter \\s patient: i dont know maybe i am maybe i dont deserve to be there \\s therapist: you dont deserve to be there \\s patient: like maybe i shouldnt be in this program i think they should just drop out \\s therapist: so if they believe youre an imposter based on these physical symptoms like anxiety mood that means to you anyway that that means you shouldnt be on there \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: whats it feel like to say that \\s patient: depressing i feel like ive worked really hard you know to get through atleast halfway through my program it really hurts to think that that will be true \\s therapist: just think this whole time you really been given faking do you really belong there so id like to move little bit into evaluating evidence so in this kind of therapy we like to look at what you know what were feeling what were thinking whats we can see whats observable around us you know that becomes evidence then we analyze it evaluate it okay youre worried at some level youre worried that you dont deserve to be where you are right now yeah that youre not good enough to be student in this program yeah programming what evidence supports that belief that youre not good enough \\s patient: now that im thinking about it here i mean theres not ton to support but in on that day i can think of all sorts of you know things to tell myself \\s therapist: whats going on that day \\s patient: so maybe like im not prepared or because im messing up on presentation that im going to get bad grade you know if i cant speak in front of people how am i going to speak in front of kids as teacher you know one day that it will translate to something else i cant get past this \\s therapist: so even if you survived program somehow you might be bad at your job \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: any other evidence that points toward you being imposter \\s patient: besides my bad grade not whole lot \\s therapist: right so to be safe to say that lot of that thought of im not good enough kind of based on your feelings of anxiety \\s patient: yeah which are really intense like panic almost in moment \\s therapist: yeah so in way youre believing with anxiety will lead you to believe \\s patient: yeah definitely \\s therapist: but in bright light of scrutiny there are lot of facts to support worst case which you dont deserve it how about evidence that refutes that youre not good enough \\s patient: i would say that you know i was accepted into program like theres kind of like pretty rigorous sort of testing stuff which i passed to get interviews such to get into program so i did that like i said im pretty good student all considering you know before this kind of flick was happening \\s therapist: okay so youve got through rigorous process to become student youre doing well you mentioned before just one bad grade right okay so if you have friends in this program right if one of them came to you with this this balance of you know one bad grade some anxiety yeah versus passing you know rigorous standards doing well otherwise what advice would you give them \\s patient: i mean now that youre kind of like talking about it like you know this or that sort of thing it makes sense i would probably say that well you seem to be doing pretty well so far you know that anyone evaluating would look at all of cumulative how youre doing your performance rather than that one grade \\s therapist: would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself \\s patient: i think i tried to sometimes but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really like you were saying your anxiety tells you sort of i think i can think that but i think my anxiety symptoms are such in moment that its really hard you know im replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again \\s therapist: so so lets look at thought feeling if you had to rate percent that you believed this thought this belief that you are not good enough to be in program like right now right now yeah but here with me how much of your mind believes that thats true \\s patient: i would say like you know two or three like not very i dont believe it very much right now because you know im not presenting its just you i not like group full of people so that pressure not there here \\s therapist: so right now youre really not buying idea that youre not good enough \\s patient: yeah that correct \\s therapist: so now lets move to lets say right in near end of presentation when that anxiety there classmates that could be looking at you it could be negatively evaluating you because youre worried about how much do you believe that thought then \\s patient: i dont feel really confident in that moment it feels very real like like any moment theyre gonna kick me out like im just not doing well im stuffing \\s therapist: yeah really intense so would you think that you were more accurate evaluator of whats true or not now or when youre in that state of anxiety \\s patient: definitely now that anxiety that you know heart rate sweating not there \\s therapist: so this evaluation percent that you believe that true this evaluation more accurate \\s patient: yes i think so \\s therapist: how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in mood right now or you can evaluate accurately \\s patient: i would say you know when im not at risk of presenting like i feel like i spend majority of my time like its not something i worry about all time just leading up to then mostly that day \\s therapist: okay so so youre able to evaluate way you are now vast majority of time right theres limited amount of time when youre not when theres lot of motions going through right at those times youre maybe little less reliable \\s patient: right like my judgment clouded \\s therapist: however in that moment you still those thoughts are strong right \\s patient: yes very troubling \\s therapist: even though its small percentage its intense you kind of carry that around little bit \\s patient: yeah exactly \\s therapist: so i can see why this frustrating for you",
            "The patient has a larger fear over everyone judging them. The patient believes other classmates recognise their symptoms of anxiety and may feel the patient does not deserve the program. The patient has had only one bad presentation in terms of grades. But on the day of presentation they think of reasons to mess up and are scared how they are going to speak in front of kids as a teacher in the future. The patient agrees a lot of their anxiety comes from their thought and not evidence. The patient agrees if they were to advice someone else in similar situation, they would assure the other person doing well and only the cumulative grades will be considered. The patient has an anxiety in anticipation that something will happen. The patient agrees their evaluation is clear at other days when they don't have presentation, however they point out that the emotions are intense during the presentation and their judgement is clouded.

\\s therapist: yeah last time we saw things were pretty chaotic hectic when you were being released from hot discharge from house for about week ago \\s patient: yeah yes \\s therapist: your hows your injury \\s patient: its its pretty pain you know had lot of pain in it ive been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication just kind of trying to keep busy focus on things that are happening ive been busy with my church duties with my kids \\s therapist: you even trying to stay fit \\s patient: yeah yeah its been hard to think about myself when i have so many other things that are more way more important than me to deal with \\s therapist: how are your kids doing \\s patient: theyre doing okay you know little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when i first got home they were little unsure of themselves what was going to happen but older older kids have helped out quite bit so i think theyre pulling together \\s therapist: imagine that theres some you know period of readjustment healing sadness or as in it sounds like also just trying to get things done \\s patient: yeah i mean my motto just to keep moving you know moving as fast as i can trying to get you know keep house clean be good you know with my duties with my church trying to keep kids focused on their activities not to be too focused on whats happening in me pauls life because you know theres nothing they can do about that \\s therapist: mm hmm so here youre taking care of lot of people your community your kids all while trying to take care of yourself thats lot \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate how much you you have going on well you know last time that we met you had talked about how important it for you to do what you can to keep your kids yourself safe i was wondering if youd be interested in talking little bit more about that today or perhaps if theres something else that you would rather talk about \\s patient: no i you know i made time today to talk about this i think its really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there so its its im looking forward to thinking about what what things i can do \\s therapist: so so you were scared it sounds like you were scared \\s patient: it was terrifying i mean we police were called you know we ended up having to call police paul was arrested spent some time in jail i had child welfare folks crawling all over my house my mom was upset neighbors were all being nosy gossiping its its it was just very scary \\s therapist: so so lot of things were turned upside down when you say it was scary i hear you saying on some level was scary for you your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive \\s patient: right i mean it was you know we had people come into house calling you know checking in are you okay or can you get restraining order my mom was trying to get me to move in with her you know its just too many you know too many cooks in kitchen \\s therapist: so lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing \\s patient: yeah yeah so im just really im not im not gonna do that im not gonna get restraining order im not gonna call police its no he knows where i live \\s therapist: so say more about that say more about why you why you dont want to call police or you dont want to get restraining order \\s patient: they were they were throwing him on ground they were holding his arms behind his back they have their guns you know that kind of you never know what police are going to do to black man you never know whether hes going to make it to jail safely so i was i was terrified for him then next day you know child welfare call in house \\s therapist: it sounds like that was very scary experience in moment for you \\s patient: yeah because im good mom \\s therapist: given that experience youre it sounds like youre part youre maybe not as inclined to think about calling police again \\s patient: yeah no no ive told my mom that thats you know thats last resort that im going to be meeting with some folks thinking about other options \\s therapist: thats what youd like to talk about today alternatives to calling police \\s patient: absolutely \\s therapist: well what have you thought about so far what other ideas do you have about what you might do in serious moment where youre scared \\s patient: mm hmm \\s therapist: for your your well being that of your kids \\s patient: i think im most afraid you know that something might happen that will be really crazy really out of control so ive been thinking about what kinds of things i could do if things are crazy out of control ive just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it was came to my mind because hes somebody who weve talked to before \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so your minister someone that youre thinking about talking to little bit about whats going on in your relationship what are your thoughts what would you what would you say to your minister what would you like to tell your minister \\s patient: im really im really interested in telling him more of truth of whats happening in my relationship he doesnt know about he has no idea that paul has threatened to kill me then hes starting to kill himself children he knows weve had some marital problems some financial problems he knows that pauls had some drinking problems so theres some of that but he doesnt know about him threatening to kill us or that hes been hitting me or his rages so i feel like you know that its time to tell them you know tell him some of that stuff \\s therapist: you feel like youve been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things what might be some advantages or reasons to do that \\s patient: hes been helpful before hes really helped us lot weve weve had counseling with him over last five years numerous times he has been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have relationship with hes been helpful in what ways he been helpful you know i think paul respects him as man i think he cares about paul so hes not you know my mom my dad my friends they theyre theyre really bordering on hating paul they dont i dont feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him that my pastor has some objectivity i think he cares about paul \\s therapist: it sounds like your pastors able to see him as whole complicated human being in same ways that that you do perhaps that theres this side of him thats scary that you dont like then theres this other aspect of him that you you really do appreciate you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well what would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust that paul might listen to what would be another \\s patient: i dont think that hes going to likely go storming into you know our pastors house paul that paul wont you know hes gonna hell he comes back in at my moms door he goes you know storming over to my girlfriends house but hes not likely to do that yeah i dont think you will \\s therapist: so so so your pastors home actually might be physically safe place for you all to go \\s patient: rightto cool off \\s therapist: hmm \\s patient: because things got so out of control crazy you know thats not going to happen again \\s therapist: so youve said that few times now that things got so out of control crazy tell me tell me little bit more about how what that was \\s patient: you know you know my eldest son got involved my arm was was was harmed things were broken he threatened to kill me he threatened to kill all of us i had to call police i had to you have people coming into my house tromping through my house grabbing paul hurting him you know he called me from jail how can you do this you know what have you done you know i felt like what have i done how can i do this \\s therapist: right so so not only was it so scary in heat of moment where you feared for your life life of your children but afterwards it was scary as well because of all things that \\s patient: all that fallout \\s therapist: yeah so so so going to your pastors talking to your pastor possibly seeing if his house might be place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore those are advantages are there any disadvantages like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about whats been going on in your relationship \\s patient: that paul will know you know if he finds out that ive talked to our minister about this you know i have no doubt how angry he will be \\s therapist: so this could really be trigger significant trigger \\s patient: yes he finds out about it \\s therapist: so thats little bit of difficult situation yeah as you think about this particular part of safety plan on one hand theres potentially some real advantages positives to speaking to your minister at same time theres this possible significant risk when you think about you know pros cons in this situation what do you what do you make of that what do you where do you go with that \\s patient: its its risk im willing to take you know i have thought about this it was you know things got so out of control i feel like its time to do something different to think about how were going to do this differently \\s therapist: youre youre really concerned \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: part of you really worried about next time you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of safety planning you also feel like its risk that youre youre willing to take given what at stake really it sounds like you feel like your life your childrens lives maybe at stake \\s patient: you know i think that things cant continue way that they are i have to figure out something thats going to work for me for my kids for paul \\s therapist: would it be right with you if i offered just suggestion or thought something to think about in terms of kids safety planning something that i know other moms in similar situation similar to yours have done that sit down have conversation with their kids about identifying safe person to either call or run to in moment when things are if if things get really crazy out of hand id be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids \\s patient: i think my oldest my oldest son that would be really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do he wants to do something hes always jumping in thats how i got hurt in first place because he was jumping in so helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe to keep him safe would would be great idea \\s therapist: yeah you so you see this perhaps as way of kind of not pulling him out of violence situation but having him turn away from violent situation as opposed to turn into it without done \\s patient: yeah hes becoming man now too he he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe \\s therapist: yeah as hes becoming man thinking about how to protect you youre also really concerned about protecting him keeping him safe ive heard you identify few things that youre thinking about doing or would like to do things that you feel like you actually do have control over last time we talked to you you were very clear about fact that you cant control paul when hes in his fear his rage being violent what ive heard you very clearly say that you want to figure out what you can control you cant control him but there are some things you have control over specifically for you that maybe talking to possibly safe person your minister \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: having that conversation to see if that might be safe person in place to go to then other pieces may be having conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in moment \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i confident vanessa that you will be able to put plan together that will work for you your family im here to support you in any any way that i can if its at all helpful id be happy to follow up with you in few days see if you feel need to talk about it some more \\s patient: thank you id ppreciate that \\s therapist: thanks for your time \\s patient: thank you",

seems to come out of blue ive never suffered from anything like this before \\s therapist: it sounds like hes getting to end of his tether because it also sounds like youre pretty fed up with whole thing as well julie \\s patient: yeah right yeah yeah \\s therapist: so just so that ive got story straight this all began about six months ago before that had you had anything like this \\s patient: no not at all i mean i think we had new manager at work i work in bank only then we had new computer system put in so it became very much stressful for all staff not just me thats i can sort of see that i was in lot more pressure that could be affecting me \\s therapist: so just to make sure ive got right right way around it began six months ago pressure at work went to town you had first of these attacks then since then youve had some more now its kind of got to point that you dont want to go out to dont get to town by yourself \\s patient: no i dont want to risk it to be honest \\s therapist: you know you dont go to pub not socializing like you used to you avoiding things like exercise things like sex having bit of taking its toll on your relationship \\s patient: yeah yeah yeah \\s therapist: okay okay looking at your i know youve had an ecg dr jones organized for you couple of months ago \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what have you been told about results of that \\s patient: well dr jones said that it was okay there were no problems you know i did feel relief you know because obviously theres been events in my family my dad died of one you know 72 so im thinking it must be my heart there must be something wrong with it right now it did feel pleased when dr jones said that but on other hand nothings changed you know im still getting exactly same problems nothing you know not getting any help with it i just feel bit like well so i havent got bad heart according to experts but im still getting all same symptoms you kow worse worse \\s therapist: so even though your gp told you theres no theres nothing to worry about with your heart do you still worry that there might be something wrong with your heart \\s patient: i cant understand it what do you think of dr julia \\s therapist: i think i agree with dr jones i dont think there anything wrong with your heart reason i say that that youve had an ecg which has come back perfectly normal usually if there was problem with heart ecg would pick something up also youve got none of risk factors really for heart disease because you you dont smoke your blood pressure from what i can gather from you notes has always been fine youre fairly young before this you were pretty fit active also i know youre worried about your dad having had heart attack but actually he was lot older than you are so youre not really in same risk sort of bracket as he would have been \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so i dont think that there problem with your heart i guess what im what weather actually whats going on little bit more what dr jones thought weather actually this this might be anxiety thats giving you lot of these symptoms have you ever thought it might be that rather than heart problem \\s patient: i think ive been thinking more recently it could be because my friend has like panic attacks ive discussed it with her she said to be honest it just sounds like that ive always thought it was my heart what i cant understand how my brain making my heart start racing like it \\s therapist: its right okay has anyone explained to about anxiety panic attacks \\s patient: i dont really know \\s therapist: okay well perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear little bit more about that what we have on top of our kidneys two little glands they called our adrenal glands \\s patient: right \\s therapist: they produce hormone called adrenalin have you heard of that \\s patient: yes i have heard of that \\s therapist: okay what adrenalin does it prepares us for situations of fight or flight that term you perhaps remember from biology at school \\s patient: i do i do yeah i do \\s therapist: you remember what we mean by fight or flies \\s patient: i think like if youre in scary situation you fight or you run away basically your body sort of triggers that \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: to do it \\s therapist: yes exactly its whats released to allow you to do flight or fight response in adrenaline so when your body needs to get ready to do something its surges out load of adrenaline adrenaline basically gets you ready for action \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so it does things like it puts your heart rate up it makes your breathing speed up youre ready to run it can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth dry it can sometimes make people feel bit lightheaded but those are kinds of symptoms that you can get \\s patient: all of those actually okay \\s therapist: what often happens with people with panic that first time that happens first adrenaline release out of blue perhaps at times of stress you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work youre feeling bit stressed out youre in town it was bit hot so that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack what happens to people that once theyve had one panic attack they go on to have more \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: reason for that that once youve had something like that happen to you youre kind of there thinking oh will this happen again \\s patient: that something that you are absolutely sure i have started to really monitor my heart when it starts to race i start to get worried then it starts getting faster faster so it does feel thats \\s therapist: yeah you describing it exactly julie thats what we call hyper vigilance so you theyre kind of keeping bit of an eye on your heart for most of us our heart rate will go up down all through day but most of us dont worry about it because we dont notice it \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but because youve had panic attack you theyre thinking whats my heart doing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: then minute it starts to change you clock it you notice it then you start to get anxious thoughts you might worry \\s patient: i really start worrying thinking thinking it going to be now you know my heart gonna stop beating \\s therapist: right so you get those kinds of anxious theyre very frightening because youre thinking oh my goodness me could my hearts on that makes you even more anxious that causes even more adrenalin to be released \\s patient: right \\s therapist: that makes symptoms even more pronounced then that makes you believe even more that theres something wrong with you does that make sense to what might be happening \\s patient: it does make sense doctor \\s therapist: one of things that you have been doing which something that lot of people with anxiety do that youve started to to avoid doing things that trigger it off \\s patient: yeah like not walking to town or anything like that anymore \\s therapist: exactly whilst in short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms because you dont have to get panicky whats happening that more you avoid doing things less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful really happens \\s patient: right yeah \\s therapist: does that make sense \\s patient: it does it just makes sense \\s therapist: well if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem there are number of approaches we can think about tablets were gonna think about other kind of talking approaches there are pros cons to those side effects things that we need to discuss so im just slightly watchful of time we seem to be coming to end of todays session for appointment but all right well i wonder whether we should meet again perhaps next week look again more carefully at some of treatment options think together about which might suit you best \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: how would that sound \\s patient: you know thats fine thats fine \\s therapist: any other questions before we end this session \\s patient: no i will make an appointment to see you next week \\s therapist: ill see you next week \\s patient: okay thank you doctor \\s therapist: pleasure all right \\s patient: bye bye",
            "Patient heart starts to race like boom boom and get chest pains. Patient cant catch breath and get very afraid like gonna have to die. Patient is avoiding sex in case that puts heart rate up. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town patient had the first of these attacks. Patient had an ECG. therapist agrees with Dr. Jones and do not think there is anything wrong with heart because ECG is normal. Patient does not smoke, blood pressure is fine, fit and active. patient is worried about his dad  having had a heart attack but he was lot older than him. SO the patient is not really in the same risk. Therapist diagnosed this might be anxiety that is giving these symptoms. Therapist explained patient about anxiety and panic attacks. Patient started monitoring heart and when it start to race but patient gets worried. Therapist told it is hyper vigilance."

very very well ive been last week i threw up some blood \\s therapist: that first time thats happened \\s patient: yeah first time i mean i threw up blood last weekend then again yesterday so theres something bad going on i know theres something bad going \\s therapist: what do you think going \\s patient: what cancer right i think i probably have cancer im not im not doing very well i just look headaches i was just \\s therapist: lets try to figure some of this out okay when you said you were throwing up blubbery throwing up bright red blood was it like little spots big spots \\s patient: it was it was almost filling toilet wasnt that much i wasnt like that it was enough that i could see it in toilet i was throwing up \\s therapist: did did you have any other symptoms \\s patient: well i was feeling sick so i had headaches i you know ive got \\s therapist: what time of day was this \\s patient: i have headaches lot \\s therapist: throughout day throwing up blood \\s patient: that was in morning then again \\s patient: other time it was sort of later in day but i \\s patient: you know i also wake up in middle of night im just covered in sweat i know thats another cancer thing \\s therapist: look i can understand why youre worried all right because throwing up blood scary waking up soaked in sweat in middle of night that doesnt feel right either let me ask you couple of questions that might help explain things when did you have your last drink \\s patient: actually just before i came here \\s therapist: okay so that was earlier this morning all right what did you have \\s patient: i had orange juice i had some vodka in it its only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out door i dont ever go out that often but right now \\s therapist: so tell me how it helps you \\s patient: its just studies me studies me like im you know im shaking all time im just like \\s therapist: so over course of day in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer how many drinks do you end up having \\s patient: five hmm maybe \\s therapist: singles or doubles \\s patient: i dont measure \\s therapist: right so it mainly vodka \\s patient: sometimes if im feeling really like my stomach really upset ill drink cider so thats its cider or vodka because \\s therapist: you ever get that feeling in morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy they need drink to calm down yeah its like only thing that works for me anything that works too so in past week do you think youve been drinking more \\s patient: in last week not so much in last couple of weeks maybe \\s therapist: hasnt been daily oh yeah right so longest youve gone without drink in last month would be how long \\s patient: i dont know actually i mean i dont know ive got you know ive got lot going on right yeah so my my sister in boston shes got cancer i know like i should be calling her i cant do that my mom really sick shes horrible im only one that who can go see her i go see my mother she just yells screams at me shes got this email its just \\s therapist: so for all of those things alcohol helps \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: yeah does it ever happen sort of by end of day that you have trouble next day remembering what happened \\s patient: i guess i mean i you know my days dont differ that much but i you know ill fall asleep in front of television then im not seeing lots of people so i you know theres not big events in my life that i would be remembering i just you know especially now that im feeling so not well that i \\s patient: yeah theres not much that i would have to remember \\s therapist: having that have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking \\s patient: i did i did \\s patient: you know i had boyfriend who \\s patient: you know was sort of casual coming over he he basically said he couldnt be with me anymore because i drink too much so i tried i tried i was like well yeah then he left so who cares right i mean right \\s therapist: you find yourself feeling feeling guilty about alcohol \\s patient: i feel guilty about my sister right i feel guilty that i cant like i just cant i cant even call her like i cant \\s patient: right so \\s patient: if i if i could pull it together than i could \\s therapist: because what i understand from what youre telling me that drinking helps meet certain need for you in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on meets need in terms of trying to keep you calmer but at same time its getting you into trouble its getting into trouble in terms of relationships but its also most likely act explanation for why youve been throwing up blood isnt why lab results that ive got are consistent with an amount of alcohol thats too much for your body to handle really really that means ideally that were going to work together to find way to do something about it",

see if you could help \\s therapist: right okay can you tell me bit more about your tummy problems \\s patient: umm well i have this terrible discomfort nearly all time it very often feels bloated i i swing between being constipated having diarrhea i have sort of cramping feelings sometimes other times it stops its real stabbing feeling i often have urge to go to toilet i pass very smelly wind \\s therapist: so quite few symptoms some of them sound more troublesome to you \\s patient: yes okay \\s therapist: how long has this been going on \\s patient: well i ive traced it back to holiday i had in egypt about four years ago i had horrible bout of sickness diarrhea i dont think my stomachs ever been really right since then \\s therapist: okay okay so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday \\s patient: yesyes \\s therapist: okayand what sort of treatments have you tried for this before \\s patient: well dr brown gave me some muscle relaxants at beginning but ive been to health shop theyve been really helpful theyve given me lots of different tablets medicines for different things now oh imodium i have imodium in my hand back all time just in case right \\s therapist: so these different tablets that youve got from herbal shop how are you taking them \\s patient: oh well different tablets you know i dont have same problem every day so ill take some tablets for certain symptoms right other tablets for other things \\s therapist: so my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on day to day basis what youre going to take depending on what your stomachs doing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay okay what about tests if you have any tests for these problems \\s patient: yes i had in early days i had gastros guess \\s therapist: theyre are gastroscopy \\s patient: yes at same time i had barium enema right that was very uncomfortable \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: but now ive tried you i dont think hes tried enough tests because he said after that that they didnt find anything hes hes just not sent me for anymore thats it now as far as hes concerned sent me back to doctor \\s therapist: right sounds as though youre not happy with that \\s patient: well you know i think that actually nhs are running out of money out there hes decided that ive had enough tests small you know if you go on internet theres loads of tests that he could have sent me for \\s therapist: right \\s patient: if i had bit more money id go private i just dont think hes got to bottom of it \\s therapist: so you feel as though actually enough hasnt been done in way \\s patient: hes not theres loads more he could do im sure right okay \\s therapist: it sounds like youve had these problems now for about four years youve youve got lot of various symptoms in your stomach youve tried lot of tablets some prescribed some herbal remedies youve had some investigations but youre not entirely happy that youve been investigated thoroughly enough that that about it \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: right okay can i ask you barbara how all of this affecting you day to day hows hows it affecting your life \\s patient: well its had quite quite big impact i mean first thing biggest thing i suppose that i i went from being full time to part time at work i just couldnt sit all day comfortably so in part time in end i hope about year ago i stopped work altogether right i missed that i missed girls we used to use least once week night to pictures or drink thats one thing \\s therapist: thats something you quite enjoyed \\s patient: yes yes yes we just have laugh \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: i used to go to swing in shape i used to go to an exercise class that was i missed exercise actually that was once week but you know thing was i wasnt comfortable never felt quite right doing all this exercise i was always worried i was going to be taken shorter so i stopped that \\s therapist: right \\s patient: then well my husband i used to go out for meals thats another thing we dont do anymore nowthats quite few things really \\s therapist: yeah it does it does sound as though over last few years your life has really changed quite lot because of symptoms its it sounds like youre doing very few of things that you used to do \\s patient: hmm right \\s therapist: what it you spend your average day doing now \\s patient: well i put around house i spent perhaps little bit too much time watching ive got bit hooked on daytime television i have to say draw you in dont do i read bit old magazines but generally im at home \\s therapist: right okay okay have you been any times of last four years that youve noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example have there been any times when things have been better for you \\s patient: last year my son got married i have to say i was worried that that i wouldnt be able to cope with it that i wouldnt be feeling well enough but surprisingly enough i was in good form i think it was about three weeks in summer getting ready for it whole heart of wedding but i was in good really good form for that yeah that was good time \\s therapist: right how were you told me symptoms then \\s patient: i hardly noticed them yes it seemed to clear up \\s therapist: nice \\s patient: which was good \\s therapist: right thats interesting are there any times when you tummy symptoms bother you more seem particularly bad \\s patient: well its im having bit of bad patch at moment its particularly uncomfortable i have to say i do notice it when my husbands away he he travels with his job he can be away couple of times month thats not very often not good then i have to say \\s therapist: so you notice its worst when your husbands not around \\s patient: maybe im thinking about it bit more i dont know when hes not there \\s therapist: right now youve been seeing dr brown about this for last few years what it that hes said that he thinks might be wrong here \\s patient: well he he thinks its all in my head hes he says its stress \\s therapist: right okay um what do you think \\s patient: well i mean it cant all be in my head i hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head i mean its real its its real pain \\s therapist: if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it \\s patient: well i mean i did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadnt cleared up in early stages but i think i mean sometimes i think its ibs friend of mines got that it sounds similar then other times i think i wonder if its an ulcer on really bad day i start to think it might be cancer \\s therapist: right \\s patient: my mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year she had growth doctor didnt investigate that by time they found it it was size of football it was it was too late to operate them so you know when i go to bed at night now i just feel make sure theres nothing different going on yeah i worry about that \\s therapist: so youre youre kind of prodding having feel at night just to see if you can feel anything \\s patient: yeah so just want to make sure theres nothing changing down there you know \\s therapist: right okay okay so just to make sure that ive got story straight youve youve seen dr brown for couple of years youve tried variety of medications some prescribed some from herbal shop none of them really made great deal of difference youve had some investigations but you perhaps feel youve not had enough investigations times you worried that this could be something quite serious like cancer that if i got story right \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: barbara what was it that you were hoping that id do for you today \\s patient: well i thought you know youre new doctor here youve just finished your medical training i wondered whether you know with new eyes new way of looking at at problem you probably know about different tests new tests that my doctor doesnt know about you know new developments that perhaps you could send me for some different tests \\s therapist: right right so youre hoping that id send you four more tests \\s patient: hmm well i think this theres got to be something that tests might reveal \\s therapist: right okay well i think barbara having having heard his story heard about symptoms im not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be most useful thing that we could do for you reason for that because youve youve had some of main investigations in last couple of years theyve not shown anything you symptoms havent really changed that much so its very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that theyd show anything different than what we already know so itd be i think it would be waste of time for you to go for more tests \\s patient: so its like do you think its all in my head that youre going to be like dr brown you think im imagining all of this \\s therapist: no i think that you clearly have pain it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms they clearly getting in way of your life causing you lot of disability i guess way i think about these things that theyre not necessarily either all in mind or all in body sometimes these things can go together i guess im thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married you were very busy quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less when your husbands away which something you dont like very much sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater so i guess what im wondering barbara if might be some kind of link with you between how you feel in your mind whats going on in your life how much you symptoms trouble you do you think thats possibility \\s patient: well i cant see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain \\s therapist: im not saying that pains in your mind i guess what im saying that sometimes way that we feel way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms given that weve tried medication for you weve tried investigations weve drawn blank really with those none of those have really helped you i guess im wondering whether now it would be good idea to try different approach to your problems \\s patient: what sort of approach \\s therapist: well i guess thinking little bit about those other areas of your life im thinking about fact that over last four years your lifes really changed it seems to have been really shrunk down it sounds as though youre not doing lots of things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of that right \\s patient: well i just cant do them yeah i cant do them anymore \\s therapist: i guess i wonder it sounds as though youve youve dropped doing those things because you felt you couldnt do them but i wonder if in funny way whats happened fact that youre not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with way that that your life at moment i guess i wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you \\s patient: oh i dont know \\s therapist: i guess what id be wondering whether one of approaches we need to be using now thinking about what you do with your life what you do with your day maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things even if its just meeting up with your female friends once week whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life im also thinking about tablets that youre taking fact that you you seem to be taking quite lot of them wondering whether its worth of sitting looking at them maybe trying to rationalize them little bit really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing which may actually be making some of these symptoms worse i guess what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference \\s patient: what two three months long time if there something going on i mean thats what happened to my mother in law you know they they left her didnt spot it \\s therapist: well i guess if we if we did decide to work together like this this new approach id be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptoms if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof they stay same then you know we could be pretty clear that theres nothing new happening that that were missing how would that sound \\s patient: so what are you saying then that i should come back see you \\s therapist: i think that would be good idea i think weve only just begun talk about it i think perhaps you need to have bit of time to think about it then perhaps come back perhaps if you booked him for double slot next week that would give us good chunk of time to think about this new approach perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make list of them we can look at what youre taking perhaps go from there how would that sound barbara \\s patient: okay well to make an appointment for next week come back see you again talk about it bit more \\s therapist: yes i think so i think that would be good good start \\s patient: ill make list of tablets that im taking here bring all bottles down \\s therapist: okay all right okay all right so see you again next week \\s patient: ill make an appointment next week \\s therapist: all right thank you barbara \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: bye bye",

house i definitely dont want to be on streets \\s therapist: so you want to stop to avoid consequences could happen \\s patient: right but to this point havent been able to \\s therapist: so this first consequence or potential consequences motivated you right since you started using \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how strong craving to use \\s patient: i mean when i first started it was i mean it was pretty freakin great i mean rush that you get from it its its just mind blowing its its just amazing but of ive noticed recently that like rush isnt as intense anymore its even like its even kind of started to backfire little bit where like actually ill feel all sick without using it i mean that kind of scares me but cravings are definitely still there \\s therapist: right so when you when you try to cut back have you tried to cut back \\s patient: i had before but minute like there there no reason to so i didnt try very hard \\s therapist: when you did try did you have feeling were you getting sick \\s patient: i did yeah it was an it wasnt as bad as as any of my buddies but i definitely i mean i didnt i didnt feel well \\s therapist: have your parents given you any options in terms of like do they understand that your seems like youre little dependent on \\s patient: yeah i mean they they do i definitely like i dont hold anything against my parents i got you i have pretty good relationship with them i know what im doing isnt isnt good for me they they said that they would completely support me they they told me that they have place picked out where i can go that theyd be willing to pay for it everything but they said if i you know if i dont meet them halfway then its just thats it like its theyre done \\s therapist: so they have solution in sense for whats going on silica like detox \\s patient: it \\s therapist: okay detox right so they have they have solution to help get you off heroin but theres still theres still part of you that doesnt want to go that route \\s patient: i mean that you know i think i think im starting to come to terms its that its time to stop it might be good that maybe im stopping so early i know i know my friends have been doing it for lot longer than i have but i just yeah i dont i dont know if detox gonna work i mean its its hard for me to focus on like anything until sometimes until i get my next fix \\s therapist: right so theres theres few problems here so so one can you can you commit to going to detox second even if you successfully complete that when you come back out if you can build void power \\s patient: right its tough right now cuz actually my my dealer lives in my neighborhood i mean hes i mean hes just like few few houses down my my girlfriend lives in our community too like hes hes on way to her house so girl kind of just maybe pick it up on my way third third my bookbag getting out my girlfriend bit then maybe on my way back home ill shoot up buddy so \\s therapist: right so you so really youre running into them as you walk to your girlfriends house \\s patient: right yeah \\s therapist: hes there temptations great \\s patient: i mean its like that house kind of thats actually where i shoot up lot so its like whenever it \\s therapist: in his house \\s patient: right right so its like whenever whenever im coming up to his house im like i start start getting excited you know like sir anticipating how how great its its gonna feel next time its i know its like stuck with me i get i get excited when its as well as you \\s therapist: know feeling so so its exploiters as soon as youre walking up to wall as youre getting ready to pass this house sumo like to all way to your girlfriend you divert to kind of go to his house you have this feeling of excitement whats thought thats going through your mind \\s patient: i like i kind of i just cant wait for for next hit now i got passes how since my parents are giving me an ultimatum now its kind of mixed because im like man if i if i get to do that somehow they find out like its its kind of all over for me then but on other hand im thinking about how how great its gonna be im just kind of like im planning in my mind how much im going to do what kind of plans well have for rest of night \\s therapist: okay so you have you have few things going on do you think like your plan right now to go into detox \\s patient: it yeah its yeah i mean my my definite plan to go into detox if detox works like i mean i think i can be done with it but its just i dont i dont know if detox can work i mean ive never only tried to cut back that one time i mean i dont know how good ill be at it you know \\s therapist: lets lets presume for second that detox would be successful you you wouldnt be one even you wouldnt be on heroin coming out of detox \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: are you worried at that point that youll go right back \\s patient: i dont know if ill go right back like i think if i can get off at detox actually work so with that said do i think i could stay off it i think like my i think my cravings will still always be there but now that its like now that ive come to realization that some of stuff that i can lose if i get caught i mean if i can get off it for good i dont i dont like i feel back it might be hard like if i run into my buddy or something \\s therapist: thats thats point of worry right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so theres there concern that youll you could you could go back if you run into them \\s patient: right \\s therapist: if you could stay away from him you think you increase your chances of being successful \\s patient: i mean yeah definitely i wont like theres theres so many like experiences in this house that that kind of to feed into anticipation cravings i mean if that doesnt happen you probably help \\s therapist: when you plans in terms of going into detox \\s patient: pretty soon i think im supposed to go on monday after weekend so like three days \\s therapist: okay so it it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place you believe will work right you have confidence that will work that your worry what will you have when you get out can you avoid it when your friends \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you dont buy from anybody else other than your friends \\s patient: no no \\s therapist: so so thats really becomes maybe one of your key goals here since since your cake sounds like youre committed to detox part right you know some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something youre \\s patient: no yeah if it works then i can try \\s therapist: so its its preparing for life after detox \\s patient: right \\s therapist: avoiding wait for phrase people places things through with with addictions or or substance use so in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend were where he lives right which unfortunately not far from you in between because houses in between your house your girlfriend \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so there way its may seem little odd but theres way to walk around block where you can completely avoid his house still get to your girlfriends house \\s patient: yeah i mean there this kind of out of way but i think yeah i could go theres like like horseshoe path i could yeah i could i could like go up block im like around horseshoe then then i can like turn right get her house there \\s therapist: she would never even see his house \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: have other options as well so theres that option how about her coming over to where your parents that was that ever happened before \\s patient: um i mean yeah shes shes come over so maybe if like maybe if i tell her that itll you know help me out she can like she can make that walk ill be like itll be easier \\s therapist: because she can walk right by house without problem \\s patient: right right i if i are walking out of house itd be harder for me to actually do what im supposed to so if i cant even leave she comes at i might be best \\s therapist: to get to work do you have to pass his house \\s patient: no no i like i worked on road so i just drive like i drive all way out to community \\s therapist: so theres kind of some like really theres physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here which just physically keeping you away from having to go by his house sounds like only reason other than to to buy use drugs to see your girlfriend \\s patient: right \\s therapist: theres an alternative strategy here right she she comes to you or you could go all way around then only round back to return to get back forth to work you dont have to go by his house at all \\s patient: yeah i could do that im gonna work \\s therapist: there ever time where he comes to you \\s patient: im honestly not that much now he obviously he doesnt he doesnt really like to leave his house much hes hes kind of going on always there so thats kind of he just deals out of there then shoots up there so he he stays in his house most of time he doesnt even come out \\s therapist: we you know we know that theres on my thoughts weve talked about this before right that on mac thoughts that lead to feelings behaviors \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: can you identify specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred not really walking by his house but when youve been in your house like this maybe its motivated you to go walk to his house \\s patient: right im bored \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: yeah just straight up i mean when when theres nothing to do in house my parents are gone so its its best way to have fun \\s therapist: so youve identified thought that that directly connects to behavior you want which on board so onboard leads to using drug assuming because that would alleviate boredom \\s patient: right \\s therapist: there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment when you say board there depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: sounds like thats your plan youre sitting in your house detox done theres no more you know we would hope withdrawal type symptoms \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thought comes upon you im bored whats its self talk piece that could be interjected there \\s patient: um i think like if i if i remember to think what i dont want to do when i think that im bored like i just kind of come up something else so i right now my usually my two choices when im bored are either to go to my buddys house or go to my grils houses you know across from my buddy so maybe that could just be like one of times i called my girl be like hey can you just like come over we can do something like just kind of distract me from from like wanting to go over dance place you know \\s therapist: so to adaptive responses call you girlfriend \\s patient: right yeah \\s therapist: on board she you know sounds like whats voice that shes really supportive of \\s patient: yeah yeah i mean she wasnt too happy with me doing it she doesnt use so i mean theres theres that social all shell be on board for that \\s therapist: it seems like consequences motivates you right thats what brought you in today like to practice anyway so im wondering if another adapter response response could involve you know i dont want any any trouble you know you can substitute lot of words in for trouble theres all kinds of trouble that can occur from using heroin \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so getting kicked out of house i dont want to you know i dont want to get kicked out my house im clean theres something else i can do here other than drugs \\s patient: right \\s therapist: like im thinking in times your girlfriend might not be around okay right so you still want to have you want to have adaptive response thats not necessarily tied to person in case she isnt around \\s patient: right \\s therapist: can use that one certainly thats good one when shes not around you kind of revisit those consequences new adaptive response do you think thats going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to house \\s patient: yeah i do i mean i like as of right now work scones good like school going good i dont i really dont want any problems i think like now if i dont realize that if i if i do keep using its not just going to be something like that i do when im bored or like that im doing for fun its going to turn into like problem thats going to kind of affects everything else so i think like if i just remember to tell myself like when im feeling bored if i just remember to tell myself like i dont i dont want to be out in streets like especially i dont want to lose my job like i think telling myself those things that will help remind me like kind of whats at stake you know \\s therapist: good good so it sounds like you have some some adaptive responses to use nothing occurs to me your parents around much \\s patient: yeah i mean theyre my dad works lot my moms usually she works to single part time job so shes usually like home at night \\s therapist: night one of times you have gone over to your friends house \\s patient: well its actually its more during day its more kind of day \\s therapist: so she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving house but only when shes there \\s patient: right \\s therapist: similar to your father you know so its really i guess we kind of narrow it down to when youre home alone particularly when your girlfriends not available thats your highest risk time right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so we have cognitive adaptive responses to come employment what was anything more behavioral we can do like can you can you go somewhere else \\s patient: well i think like one of one of other things i do to kind of clear my head as i like to go for drive so like if i if i start feeling bored i think maybe if i like get in my car like i said all of that thats his stuff i just drive away like just physically leave temptation then like from there i can go to bookstore or like comic book store like i can i could spend hours in there so maybe if i can like i can remind myself to drive away go to stores like maybe i can just kind of stay out there like enough till either like my girlfriends home or my parents come home \\s therapist: i think thats good i think its good plan yeah remember that more we apply these adaptive responses right what we hope that you risk decreases like your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increases \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so while it may be only convenient to drive someplace every time no ones available youd have thought that might not be something i do forever \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: but thatll thatll minimize risk for now we want to we want to focus on short term first then well worry more about midterm long term \\s patient: right \\s therapist: then circumstances may change maybe you he reside there forever maybe some of his work schedule change maybe there are other adaptations you can make \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but but for now i think this would be good way to go just keeping you away from circumstance \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you definitely dont want \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so good news few behavioral pieces we have in here then few cognitive as well so i want to see in couple of days before we go into detox \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so that we can practice some of these adaptive responses are like good practice some at home between now right as well \\s patient: right yeah \\s therapist: these behavioral responses as well but well try to get them shored up before detox ill see it right after you come out as well \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: well make sure that we just keep working on applying refining his adaptive cognitive responses his adaptive behavioral responses right does that sound like plan \\s patient: yeah definitely i think that will definitely help especially especially being in here after detox that would definitely definitely be best \\s therapist: i appreciate you coming in jesse ill see you in couple days \\s patient: yeah thank you thank you \\s therapist: thanks",

            "therapist: good afternoon bruce im glad you could make it in today thanks for coming in last week when you were you had come in because you had had positive urine analysis test for marijuana so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether how did you feel about our talk last week \\s patient: it was okay i guess \\s therapist: yeah just okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right okay so i want to refresh your memory ive got my notes here do you mind if i refer to my notes \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: yeah i wasnt in mood \\s therapist: im wondering what you could have done in world \\s patient: im not sure what i could have done \\s therapist: so because of not exercising did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week \\s patient: yeah it was used bit more \\s therapist: okay okay so how would you tie those two things together by not running \\s patient: i think mix when im not exercising generally i would turn to more usage \\s therapist: yeah yeah so when you reflect back now on last week rain coming down it was cold im wondering if there was way that you could change your perception about that such that it wouldnt stop you from running what do you think \\s patient: yeah to change perception above maybe wear rain jacket or something \\s therapist: mm hmm that would be great idea that would be an excellent idea \\s patient: well i tried to stay away but i didnt i still saw some of them \\s therapist: so it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life last week \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you tell me more but what was difficult about it \\s patient: stuff that they think something badly of i didnt want them to think you know avoiding raising \\s therapist: so you did it sounds like you didnt want to hurt their feelings \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: by them thinking that you were going to avoid them \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so as result of this what what happened \\s patient: well i just ended up going to see them then hanging outand yeah \\s therapist: so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana that correct \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: im wondering how you could do that differently this week \\s patient: well i could i suppose i could just try hard enough to go see you guys \\s therapist: what would that involve trying harder not to go see them \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: yeah sometimes it that simple just making that commitment yourself just drawing line do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with \\s patient: yes i do i dont feel that often but i could i could start to see that more \\s therapist: okay how about motivated on scale of one to 10 would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that dont smoke pot \\s patient: three \\s therapist: okay so youre still youre still little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again but i have to ask you bruce what do you what made you say three instead of one \\s patient: well because i know for all so i feel like i need to i think i should start doing something about it \\s therapist: i think thats great insight that youre able to see that moving towards friends that dont smoke pot making effort to do that actually going to enhance your life incredibly when you associated with friends that didnt smoke pot in past what kind of things did you do \\s patient: like what what kind of things activities things \\s therapist: yeah was it fun to be with them \\s patient: yeah it was fun yeah we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activities maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing usually its not so like you know theres more they tend to do more healthy activities i would say \\s therapist: so you can recall living healthier life then having fun outdoors basically having healthier life overall without using pot \\s patient: yeah youre right there it could be i might take my mind off of it \\s therapist: sometimes its good to remember having those good times with friends that didnt smoke pot because it makes you realize that you dont really need it i think thats great i think thats great idea \\s patient: was i really had lot of second thoughts i was worried about commitment that kind of thing so i didnt feel like that was right right idea \\s therapist: okay so you had some second thoughts about that youre excited about it last weeks session but after you had chance to reflect upon it you kind of realized that it wasnt getting dog was not best thanks for you \\s patient: lot of commitment lot of time that i just dont have motivation to be putting in \\s therapist: i think thats wise to recognize that right up front im given research on pets any kind of pet how it helps people sustained from alcohol drug usage im wondering if there another option that you might consider \\s patient: maybe what do you have in mind \\s therapist: im thinking do you like pets that arent dont require such commitment \\s patient: thats good idea i didnt think about that \\s therapist: because dog dog large commitment \\s patient: yeah you know theres all kinds of animals snakes or fish or something \\s therapist: hey snakes fish that would definitely be star these animals that you like \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right i think its important that you have an animal that you like that you can relate to alright so in final goal was to find join support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana how did you make out with that \\s patient: i look into it but like i went to first first meeting i just felt like like those people were bought on barrel i was just not i just didnt fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place \\s therapist: so you made effort to go you went \\s patient: i couldnt i just didnt want to stay \\s therapist: so you didnt stay whole time \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so you left early because you felt you didnt feel you they were bottom of barrel youre still higher functioning \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i can definitely understand im wondering if there any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you what do you think \\s patient: see there could be some positive i just dont i dont i just dont see it that much at this point \\s therapist: what might be some positives that you would get out of support group \\s patient: well i would i would probably be able to relate to people in same kind of situation maybe its just positive to be able to have connection with people like that im not sure \\s therapist: so youre youre saying that past of being in support group would be that youd get chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey to have connections with other people again i can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot but from increasing feel good hormones in your body connection relating to other people it might be similar when you were younger you had mentioned last week that you were hockey player so you had support that was sort of like team was sort of like support group im wondering if you could relate to people in head connections wondering if you could see support group as team \\s patient: yeah it would probably be same kind of situation like essentially people in support group are all there for same goal so its kind of like in hockey very important there to win mm hmm \\s therapist: do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team \\s patient: yeah it was good \\s therapist: it gave thats because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections so how committed do you think you are if i were to send you list of support groups so you could try out some others where there werent bottom of barrel as you say there how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week \\s patient: probably eight or 10 yeah \\s therapist: wow what made you say an eight rather than four five was just \\s patient: team analogy i think good analogy \\s therapist: so you thought how you remembered you remember how you felt when you were on team how it gave you that sense of connection \\s patient: yeah also you know i dont have to be mean if if i think of it as team maybe i would be like star on team because im not quite so bottom of barrel maybe \\s therapist: i love that analogy good thinking its thinking bruce thats excellent wow well just to summarize today you came in you had made some progress but you had some stumbling blocks you have decided that whether its rain or shine youre going to run anyway because youre going to have you raincoat youre going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than friends that are not such good influence on you getting pet rather than getting it dog youre going to look into getting snake or what was other thing \\s patient: oh fish yeah \\s therapist: okay in terms of support group i will send you list of support groups you feel that on scale of one to 10 that youre about an eight actually carrying through trying out two of these support groups because of hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate todays session \\s patient: it was good very good \\s therapist: if we were to put it on scale of one to 10 \\s patient: eight \\s therapist: out of eight all right we did get in if we did an eight \\s patient: all right \\s therapist: way to go \\s patient: thanks \\s therapist: all right thanks",

            "therapist: okay charles lets take look at your homework from last week activity schedule \\s patient: not very much on it \\s therapist: ill take look at it see well you did complete most of it \\s patient: i dont see point i mean how do you master watching tv or eating meal i if i had tried to use chopsticks i suppose it would have some mastery involved in but i i didnt mess with chopsticks okay food was okay hmm but not not great okay \\s therapist: so it was tough i just want to be clear though charles that this very typical though for many people that we work with its very difficult to complete homework worksheets because things happen right i dont feel that well sometimes things get in way theres things that just prevent me from doing that so i think our job together to try to figure out what are sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult so what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to your mastery ratings \\s patient: i dont enjoy anything i used to i used to enjoy it lot of things but i dont even i dont look forward to breakfast particularly cup of coffee news mostly bad what if there news i mean paper doesnt carry much national news anymore so i mean i have to eat but i really dont see point of lot of things \\s therapist: okay okay well i think something that will be useful for both of us charles to collaboratively work together figure out how we can look at perceived benefit of doing some of these things versus cons so theres worksheet that i have called decisional balance worksheet it basically takes two separate decisions one decision to engage in activities theres some benefit to doing that then another decision would be to not engage in activities theres benefit to that but theres also cost to both of those decisions so i think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are sort of things you could do determine whether theres more benefit or cost to completing that what do you think about that \\s patient: well that would depend on activity i know but okay i could i could get in touch with somebody i could call friend maybe try to meet somebody for lunch \\s therapist: okay thats great idea so what would be benefit of calling friend or meeting someone for lunch \\s patient: well i would i would enjoy company okay wouldnt be as lonely i suppose \\s therapist: okay that sounds great so sounds like one benefit would be youd enjoy company yeah you wouldnt be as lonely so id write that down okay good \\s patient: company company said not as lonely not only thats good okay \\s therapist: okay can you think of downside to potentially doing that \\s patient: well one downside might be that he wouldnt be interested in having lunch with me i havent been whole lot of fun lately or he might be busy might not not might not be able to have lunch \\s therapist: okay or \\s patient: he might want to talk about whats going on in my life im ready we dont want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course okay \\s therapist: so it sounds like most practical one of those would be that he may be busy \\s patient: right that could be downside that right okay might not be able to come sure \\s therapist: okay so id write that great job charles with top two boxes with first decision so lets move to second decision which would be to stay same theres some benefit to that theres some cost to that as well sure okay charles so we completed worksheet so whats your overall impression about benefits of changing versus cons staying same \\s patient: well it makes sure that benefits outweigh cons if if i make change if i dont make change ill be doing just what ive been doing ill be getting up wondering whats point well still be lonely \\s therapist: those are good observations charles so which activity doesnt make most sense to try for homework this week \\s patient: well i call somebody i think okay \\s therapist: okay thats good observation so lets say for homework then you tried to call someone to get together with friend how about also trying to complete full day of activity schedule completing both mastery pleasure ratings what do you think about that \\s patient: sure okay \\s therapist: okay if it gets difficult which again thats pretty normal for that to take place if it gets hard we can talk about it next time we can problem solve together figure out how to remove those barriers does that sound good \\s patient: sure okay okay",
            "The therapist discusses patient's last week homework schedule. The patient is disinterested to carry out the activities. The therapist explains that it is a decisional balance worksheet and request to weigh pros and cons for each activity. The patient feels calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch sounds exciting and wouldn't be as lonely. The therapist highlights the practical downsides to that maybe the person is busy and not able to come from the responses from patient. The patient agrees the cons of staying the same will not change anything and they will feel lonely. The therapist encourages to meet someone as a homework and asks to try out a full day activity schedule. The therapist aknowledges it will be hard and the problems can be addressed in next session."

on drug front \\s therapist: mm hmm \\s patient: its as you know adderall im really struggling \\s therapist: still struggling with adderall \\s patient: yeah im not sure what to do because i know that i mean im having such hard time with it but when i dont have it i am im just not functioning im not able to get as much accomplished \\s therapist: right so go ahead \\s patient: well its its like its always there to \\s therapist: its always available \\s patient: its always available yeah or so much at time \\s therapist: youre having some mixed feelings about it so im sensing \\s patient: yeah yeah like i know i want to stop \\s therapist: you think you think you want to stop \\s patient: yeah no i do \\s therapist: you do \\s patient: oh my god see i feel crazy but i know it would be good if i didnt have it in my life \\s therapist: but at same time it in your life \\s patient: i dont know how to get out of that i mean one thing if i didnt live with my roommate that would be one thing like it wouldnt be in apartment all time \\s therapist: so you find you have easier access to adderall when youre when youre in house or apartment with your with your roommate \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so if you physically werent there like with your roommate in that apartment \\s patient: yeah like if i was oh my god living at home with my parents again or even living with somebody else i guess oh my god move what hassle but thats i mean thats problem its just there its its accessible \\s therapist: so youre kind of it sounds like youre recognizing that maybe you dont have willpower to stop taking drug when its right there in front of you \\s patient: maybe youre right yeah thats thats good because before i didnt really want to stop at some i mean i definitely sometimes i want to stop im my mind ill go back forth you know but for most part i would like to be without it you know i really dont want to deal with this anymore \\s therapist: so mostly so so theres still some feelings for you you want to use it but mostly you would like to stop \\s patient: well it makes us so easy to get stuff done i mean i just take couple boom boom boom i mean \\s therapist: so theres some advantages for you \\s patient: yeah definitely definitely im so used to it so its just comfortable \\s therapist: its comfortable it allows you to be productive are there any downsides to it \\s patient: well yeah when i dont have it crash its like really bad crash im not productive you know its its its gotten worse than it used to belike i need it \\s therapist: so its painful \\s patient: its painful definitely definitely it feels like trap i want out \\s therapist: one of ideas youre having was sound like potentially was moving out moving out of apartment because then you wouldnt have access to who would have access to adderall anymore or it would be hard to get \\s patient: oh my god like sometimes its really weird sometimes it feels like thats good idea then sometimes im like no no i dont want to be you know kind of cut off from it but i think i am come ready \\s therapist: you think youre ready for that \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that moving out you really see what you would need to do because stopping while living there too difficult \\s patient: yeah yep i think youre right \\s therapist: remember before youve tried to stop living there few times right or or last few months with your roommate having it with your roommate being one that gives it to you it just appears that temptation so great for you \\s patient: yeah she really doesnt get it she doesnt understand like what what problem this for me shes definitely not supporting me or anything like that yeah god maybe it would be better \\s therapist: well are there any disadvantages to living with your parents \\s patient: living with my parents at my age it just feels like little bit humiliating lot humiliating \\s therapist: okay so humiliation would be one \\s patient: yeah just this feeling of failure embarrassment then my mom just in my business \\s therapist: so some clear disadvantages to move into paris any advantages other than obvious who would separate you from adderall \\s patient: am i would you buy laundry fully stocked fridge \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: yeah my dad will fill my gas tank up \\s therapist: things that happened before \\s patient: uh huh \\s therapist: so theres some disadvantages to this plan but theres some advantages theres key advantage of being think of narrow \\s patient: yeah it wouldnt necessarily have to be rest of my life either just for now just to get me out of that apartment with drug right \\s therapist: that would separate you from drug you could potentially move out later on \\s patient: oh my god do i want to i mean that thats just it like its like it sounds really good until i like really think about it \\s therapist: when you really think about it what comes to mind \\s patient: oh like i start to shake like that feeling of you know when you really want something you really want something you cant get to it that desperation that im like right now i know that you know im living there it could be my choice i could take it or i could not take it you know but at least when i want it its there if i move out im like making that decision for myself \\s therapist: thats right it would be \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: it tough \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: before it seemed like youre really more on side of making this change than not clearly theres still some things you want to consider \\s patient: no you know youre right though i want out its not really choice when im there like i say i have choice yes or no but choice always yes \\s therapist: you always end up using adderall \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so so make sure i understand situation overall you live with your roommate she has that role she makes it available to you use it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youve tried to stop that behavior but thats just not working for you \\s patient: yeah yeah thats so clear i dont want to be using it \\s therapist: you dont want to be using it but yet you are especially because proximity right like cuz youre right there she has it its just tougher to stop that behavior theres another possible decision which moving back home which has some disadvantages advantages \\s patient: yeah thats true it would be nice having that fully stocked fridge \\s therapist: so that theres an upside to it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that would be beyond just not using drug which would which fit itself itd be big victory for you \\s patient: yeah my mom would be there to talk to yeah yeah \\s therapist: so lets do this it seems like thats direction youre moving right \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: no pun intended with moving but thats youre you youre thinking that might be better way to go \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so for next session lets plan out that this wouldnt necessarily be doing anything this would just be lets plan out steps that youd have to put in place to move out to move back home talking to your parents whatever financial arrangement have roommate getting all your stuff out logistics of moving lets just go through steps \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: try to get firm plan together of course you can always re evaluate change your mind \\s patient: okay right \\s therapist: but all were doing at this point just just planning seeing how it would look \\s patient: this kind of exciting \\s therapist: exciting \\s patient: yeah it definitely i can do that \\s therapist: so i will see you next week \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: well pick up where we left off well well start with planning well see what happens with that \\s patient: cool all right \\s therapist: thanks",

of you to be drinking not driving thank you how has it affected your life \\s patient: who hasnt well i mean none of this happens you have it because of that firefight hes gonna be disappointed sorry i guess you could say that my relationship with henry its been great fantastic but he says that when i drink its like im not myself its like somebody whos never met before obviously you can imagine arguments fights oh my god all that stress its just i love them so much but you know but its stress its like i dont forget to make it \\s therapist: so for my understanding drinking it helps you socialize with friends it relaxes you its you know your way of just you know it breaks that ice for you on other hand its causing that lot of arguments with you your significant other henry yeah its causing lot that all those arguments are leading to lot of stress in your relationship this kind of stuff \\s patient: yeah i mean were engaged in this as well like you put it that way i mean worried because whats he going to think of you later on in life whats he going to tell our children oh your moms an alcoholic she drank this they got into fight i dont want i dont want anyone to ever think of me that way but at same time i mean i dont want to quit cold turkey i mean you must understand how hard this for me to even be here talk about it but i love him so much i mean i would do anything for him hes going to be so disappointed in me hasnt even seen him like i dont know how can i face them \\s therapist: this seems like very lucky guy to have someone love him that much \\s patient: boy seriously hes not gonna find anybody that loves him as much as i do trust me on that not going to happen \\s therapist: so what im getting here right now that if you do want to quit yeah yeah its just partly because this alcohol divided into arguments with henry his positive ssl relationship yeah i know we spoke about earlier i know you dont really like like idea of it but what do you know about it like whats your one shed some light on that \\s patient: its place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems like i said im not an alcoholic \\s therapist: well youre different multiple philosophy life this share drinking stories everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together okay i know you dont want to join at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking generally consider joining it maybe later on down road \\s patient: if this what i have to do to get my guy back ill do it \\s therapist: okay well on scale of one to 10 being like for sure one being not really sure about it at all what would you say where you are on scale with god any \\s patient: you put it that way everything i told you i would say six \\s therapist: six yeah \\s patient: well its all about its all about henry at end of day its it matters to me if i want to keep this engagement i will do anything for that man so of course this what i have to do in this this him let him tell you his relationship with me im with him so much more important to me than drunken nights at bar \\s therapist: i love you man like i said \\s patient: ill tell him that \\s therapist: yeah so right now were sitting at six or what needs to happen maybe we can jump that money or nine \\s patient: um you know like flexible hours maybe that isnt even an option um also maybe theres maybe theres place nearby somewhere like nearby my house ill be great so i have to use gas because its expensive already to go to work its far anyway im like i guess i guess it has to do with attitude as well i dont want to sit there in circle like this somebody judging me because way i look in my drinking habits all that so i guess im just looking for good vibe you know i dont want to be judged or labeled \\s therapist: now all of these are like very understandable i mean its just of course you want some in meeting to be close to us you dont have to commute so far yeah we all have very busy schedules now fit very busy schedule it definitely makes sense of course environments i mean if youre not happy theyre just human learning environment if youre not comfortable there then its very hard for you to you know to be in that environment yeah blotchy today i was wondering if its okay with you i can give you this for sure its just for median youre really close to your location where you live okay my number also on there give me call if you have any concerns also i just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking i know its not you know easy to just notice no its very sensitive subject yeah so i want to thank you \\s patient: thank you for listening to me no ones has actually sat down talked to me about anything i feel like you shed some light on an issue so thank you youre very welcome really means lot \\s therapist: youre very welcome if its okay with you perhaps we can schedule another follow up meeting id say about two weeks or so \\s patient: yeah that sounds fine yeah thats okay two weeks work two weeks yeah",

husband \\s patient: hmm yup \\s therapist: sandra having just explore some of your feelings around situation you have im going to suggest that you speak to jeff on an empty chair this may be little uncomfortable but it helped me to facilitate process where i become an observer youll be in dialoguing with party that you are actually having to deal with ill be facilitating for you process then pointing out some of things that we could do to change process okay its been jeff your imagination that massive jeff were here ill bring chair okay welcome jeff i mean i welcome jeff theres jeff imagine his face looks like how you remember him bring him in your fantasy then when youre ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment this moment spontaneous \\s patient: jeff i feel very frustrated about situation that you have left me children in i think you understand how hard it at times things that i have to explain to them about about this situation it bothers me that you dont go out of your way to spend extra time with children i really believe that in future they they will come to to really resent that not look at you as as their father i i honestly cant understand why you dont want to spend more time with them irrespective of whats happened between between us you moving on so forth i just dont think that that your children my children should really suffer in that way wed like them to have as as normal life as possible be able to to be with both of their parents why you know what so important rather than them wanting to be with them its its just very hard \\s therapist: okay okay so theres kind of question you understand why this happened etc right so what next thing well do youll sit over there you will be jeff see what jeff can answer to you as to where he at that maybe little bit difficult but lets do dialogue as if he were hes not here anyway \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so well well be having dialogue between jeff imaginary jeff you in present here now okay what what he saying i know theyre hurts frustration but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as father \\s patient: i really dont have any appreciation for that because reason reason that youve given that youre busy like im busy in my life i still give our children priority they still take precedence in my life i just dont think that that that thats right \\s therapist: actually what kind of father you should be for children \\s therapist: you should be proactive in wanting to save them i wouldnt mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed there are times when when you want to do something spontaneous see then then then feel free to contact us see if its okay \\s therapist: sounds like very good idea good offer you jeff are you prepared to take that off for kids sake its great go your way whats whats going on here contracts happening okay seems parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important thats children so children will not suffer they will actually benefit from that agreement if you two can really really come to mutual agreement to what how were going to take care of children because thing no matter how in my view no matter how people live together as couple separate together contract life countries im still my father to my children as mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out we can come to an agreement as to how were going to work together even if you dont they dont live together we would live for with kids theyd be happy does that make sense to you \\s patient: yes this in counseling session he hasnt really participated in informing his contract \\s therapist: but you hear that this happened for you youve done it so there something that now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him no matter how he because theres now new realization that children need that father mother hows that for you \\s patient: yeah maybe i just need to let him know that just extend invitation of having more time out there yeah yeah \\s therapist: youre good at that youre very good whos watching you working here youre very good at creating contracts very clear about what you want its question of how you can two parties can get to that agreement together what do you think \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: great because thats this rehearsal for whats going to

patient: yeah my boss sent me over \\s therapist: your boss said sure \\s patient: there was this issue with couple of people that couldnt relate to my ideas my boss solid has been kind of you know not working super well so she wanted me to come over talk about \\s therapist: she wants you to come over talk about your relationship with your coworkers \\s patient: um i think more just so that you know my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really understand so maybe learn how to like how to talk to other people so that they can understand me \\s therapist: okay what would you mean by higher like your ideas \\s patient: are higher you know just little bit more intelligent you know im just at level that other people cant always reach to you just you know like just little bit higher sometimes lot higher but just on this team they just couldnt understand you know my language or what i was saying it couldnt see vision that i had \\s therapist: okay so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this was like project youre working on your boss recognized this difference thought that that counselor may be helpful yeah \\s patient: yeah yeah um i think its good you know so that my boss happy that i went but i think it could also be useful in sense of you know other people are jealous of me lot they just cant really relate to me so it might be you know great to learn how to relate you know like kind of understand what theyre going through at their level \\s therapist: again you stay at their level so are you meaning again that theyre kind of below you with skills \\s patient: yeah theyre just they havent they havent accomplished as much they have you know they dont know as many people theyre not hanging out with those prestigious ranks you know they havent been educated to quality that i have been so they just sometimes its hard for them to understand where im coming from or you know what i can see happening \\s therapist: okay so counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively \\s patient: yeah so i think you know so i can even better you know im here but i want to be like here \\s therapist: when you say youre here at first level \\s patient: maybe like seven but i want to like blow it out park you know like if 10 here i want to be higher than that \\s therapist: how would you plan on accomplishing that \\s patient: well you know im always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes to speak places people are always calling im really large social media presence when people are constantly asking me for advice you know just about everything because you know ive just accomplished so much that i can really help people because i just you know ive just been really lucky to just be good at so many things \\s therapist: okay so it sounds like youre you have lot of stress \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: maybe from your understanding that people were just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things \\s patient: yeah you know like sometimes people just its hard to admit that youre just not as good or like you cant do it maybe you dont want to admit that i think i make them uncomfortable because i can \\s therapist: so calcium help you to relate to them in way that so how would they have more productive way how would they describe you you know given this level of difference on this youre talking about how would they describe you if i were to ask them if i could ask them could you describe sample \\s patient: would they say i think they would say that i have lot of people that look up to me that im excellent at my job that you know like i should really be vice vice president if not president but i mean i dont own company but i should really have more significant position that lot of presentations that are happening that i could probably do but they dont want to you know other people need opportunities but it would it would be clear for everyone if i just did them \\s therapist: would it be easier \\s patient: yeah you know easier better more people it would just be it would be great presentation if i did it so well just cut away all other stuff \\s therapist: all those stuff thats what your coworkers would include \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: yeah things that maybe detract from them \\s patient: right like if you know if i was doing sales pitches we could blow it out of park i mean wed be multimillionaires by now so you know it would get rid of all that you know grunt work type of stuff if i just did it myself \\s therapist: does it frustrates you that youre not calling for every task \\s patient: youre not recognized sometimes but ive gotten really good at reminding people that they shouldnt be calling on me for every task because im you know sometimes you just have to show them you know im better than that person or i could do it better im really good at that type of communication so ive been able to secure lot of positions that werent given to me at first because they realize like oh shes better at it so they can see your talent \\s therapist: so they recognize you most of time \\s patient: no i mean most of time yeah \\s therapist: how long have you been with this particular employer \\s patient: um maybe like six months six months maybe eight months okay \\s therapist: can you tell me about job youve had prior like what happened there \\s patient: an ai algorithm they so i got it i got it to really you know large leadership position then you know other vp couldnt really see see what i was going for she couldnt relate to me she you know she she wasnt from same type of like collegiate backgrounds that was kind of an issue so i just outgrew what they had to offer then this company came in made this tremendous offer with you know it was just it was just fantastic so i just had to make move that was more strategic for me you know that i could that i could even reach more you know i didnt i didnt want to be satisfied there \\s therapist: you want to you want to shoot higher you want to accomplish something greater \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: more so more stuff youve already achieved some level of popularity \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: alright so your last ploy or one before place you work now you just outgrew that can you tell me how that interaction went like did you quit or did they encourage you to leave like what happened to kind of last moments of that job \\s patient: um well i mean \\s therapist: so you initiate it you quit at same time they had few issues with type issues they have \\s patient: they just said i you know i talked too much or something like that or i think there was an issue with somebody i was working with or something but it was really it was another situation that just didnt we just we werent we werent communicating well but in end i had to do what was best for me so because afterwards they were calling me trying to get me back but i was already here so that i wasnt gonna go back there \\s therapist: so i have to quit pursuit you to come \\s patient: yet for them again yeah which i told them was gonna happen \\s therapist: you predicted that when you left \\s patient: yeah it was like youre gonna youre gonna miss me cuz im reason this company flourishing \\s therapist: so what did you tell them when they offered you \\s patient: chargeback that i was had gotten phenomenal job it was way better that they lost it they could just deal with it \\s therapist: so you rejected them at that point okay \\s patient: yeah i you know i want to make my boss happy but i feel like it would be good you know i dont want to make people feel bad because theyre inferior to me because theyre not as successful so if i could learn how to even talk with them so that im not you know so they dont feel bad about themselves \\s therapist: its your boss putting i mean she encouraged you to come here today she putting any pressure on you like this something thats strongly encouraged mandatory \\s patient: i think its strongly encouraged i think she has promotion for me in mind so its probably just to set me up for that \\s therapist: so shes trying to help you for future another advancement so sam im going to get you on calendar to see counselor open later this week that work for you okay that does so ill get you set up for that i really appreciate you taking time with me it was helpful origin to see counselor well go from there \\s patient: yeah sure thank you",

come in just i dont want to talk to you anymore because i come in here i talk i talk i talk talk i dont get anything out of it youre all same \\s therapist: when you say \\s patient: you are all of you all of you all therapy \\s therapist: okay i mean im having couple three reactions to what youre saying i mean one that youre saying youre all same \\s patient: were all same youre all same in for you guys nothing working right nothing working \\s therapist: i mean im feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now \\s patient: well you are because youre all same of course youre lumped in with everybody im not gonna single you out not gonna make you you know single you out because youre not doing anything you dont do anything theres all this abstract metaphysical stuff theres no concrete this way to fix it this goal theres nothing so whats point \\s therapist: i mean its theres something specific right now that i could say or do that that would fill give you what youre wanting or need \\s patient: how do i how do you how do i go from point to point b how do i get better how do i fix whats going on i mean thats reason i came here right i thought there was reason i came here to fix things make things better \\s therapist: so you want sort of like kind of sort of like step by step description of \\s patient: what something i need something to grab onto something to hold something grab onto yeah \\s therapist: yeah see my sense that you know that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to to get to give you some sense of hope i really want to be able to you know to give you something but but it feels like theres something about kind of intensity of your of your sort of demand or play right now which which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in way thats going to give you what you need or you know better way of putting it you know have sense that kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between two of us theres something about sort of intensity of your desperation with which makes it difficult for you to really be open receptive to whatever i have to give \\s patient: just way i am i always come out like that i always sway i get things so only way i get thats only way i know how to be i come out one of two ways i come out either full full throttle just full full tilt just come out just do it that way or i dont do anything at all so its like i one way its not good enough on other way its not good enough so \\s therapist: so its like \\s patient: damned if you do damned if i do damned if i dont if i go one way at everybody it you know it doesnt seem to make difference one way or other then if im just quiet you know just fall in with crowd it doesnt matter either so \\s therapist: it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices right that you can you can either approach situation kind of on attack you know with with both guns blazing its good way to describe \\s patient: it both guns blazing \\s therapist: right or or alternative to kind of go along compromise yourself in some way right right have those two which which feels better which feels worse \\s patient: well bulk guns blazing always feels better because if i go at somebody with with you know full force you know hit them over head you know just just go at them even if they turn away it doesnt really matter because ive already sent my face so when i say but if i dont say anything i just sit back dont do anything then it just gets me as angry as full guns blazing so it just they eats me up but it eats me up in here i get even angrier than if i just blurt it all out get it all out \\s therapist: right yeah i can imagine that right that right if you end up you know at least if youre going in there with with both guns blazing theres way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way even though youre not getting your needs met right but somehow theyre you know sort of giving in its like youre giving away part of yourself in some way so i mean you know it seems to me that you know dilemma that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now right you sort of desperately need something right but middle ground theres no middle ground okay so you know im not sure exactly what that middle ground right now but im willing to work with you to you know to really work on discovering what that middle ground does that does that seem worthwhile \\s patient: i have to have to find middle ground \\s therapist: okay but what are you feeling right now \\s patient: just it bothers me i cant go one way or other its like try to do one thing you cant do it try to other way cant do it just im just stuck \\s therapist: theres real kind of sadness there \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: look at me sense of whats whats going on for us it sounds as if here youre asking for something yeah \\s patient: i need something i cant get myself \\s therapist: yeah yeah i you know i hear that i hear you know youre sort of desperation i hear your sadness your pain your hopelessness you know when ill do my best to help you",

            "therapist: hey lewis how you doing today \\s patient: i am okay how are you \\s therapist: im doing well thanks for asking how things been going \\s patient: theyve been alright \\s therapist: last time we were talking it sounds like youre still having some difficulty with quizzes mm hmm that still case \\s patient: yeah its still its still panic when i take them theyre still panic \\s therapist: can you tell me about process of taking quizzes i know we tested on little bit before \\s patient: okay so im going to class im fine i sit down to take test im fine test in front of me question one im not going to get that answer \\s therapist: so youre looking down so you take these quizzes in class \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: like paper pencil \\s patient: hmm hmm \\s therapist: okay with other students around you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: alright having other students around distracting you \\s patient: no what has happened in previous online classes same \\s therapist: so its youre pretty sure its quiz itself not some external \\s patient: hmm yeah \\s therapist: okay so it was paper pencil you seated in room rooms relatively distraction free \\s patient: yeah yeah everybodys quiet \\s therapist: youre looking down at really first item on on quiz whats happening whats happening that as you look down you read that first item whats happening at thought well start thought level whats happening what are you thinking \\s patient: im thinking im reading question im thinking oh my god theres okay theres four okay so its got to be its got to be one of them i am not going to pick right one im gonna think i pick right one its going to be one that second choices i am not going to pick right one \\s therapist: okay so your thought that youre going gonna get youre gonna select wrong response therefore get that quiz item wrong \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how about behavior like do you notice anything physically going on as youre thinking about that quiz item how youre going to get you call \\s patient: to my palms are probably sweaty like im probably little tense \\s therapist: little tense \\s patient: yeah thats really \\s therapist: so it could be that this thought of im going to get this item wrong leading to these uncomfortable feelings physical feelings all right so what happens when you answer item one like you dont know if you have right or wrong immediately right because its paper pencil so you answer item one you move on to item two what happens then \\s patient: starts all over again im already like well i already got first one wrong now my i chances are higher getting this one wrong \\s therapist: so if you like it because you because you thought that you got first one wrong thats your chances again cycle on one wrong actually increase \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: if i get one to one wrong whole test gonna to be wrong \\s therapist: have you ever had quiz that youve taken where you were confident that you got first item right \\s patient: im sure i have i cant remember any \\s therapist: but eventually youre going to come to one item that your doubts about \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: right \\s patient: inevitably it happens \\s therapist: theres gonna be one thats maybe little more difficult or difficult for you so it seems like what youre saying that when you reach that item where you have that thought from from that point on next item more difficult because youre having similar thought does that pattern continue \\s patient: throughout test yes \\s therapist: so explain to me what like lets just go with example first item like because just just to keep it more simple so you have first item that didnt work out for that thought right second one your thought was i have even greater chance of missing so what happens after you respond to that second item \\s patient: it just compounds i just start i feel worse than worse as quiz as i continue \\s therapist: thats awful so its an awful feeling for me \\s patient: yeah right \\s therapist: so by time you get to item five or six \\s patient: im convinced im its over ive gotten to zero if its yeah if isnt first ive gotten to zero ive gotten bad grade \\s therapist: right so thats whats on your mind \\s patient: uhh hmmm mm \\s therapist: how are those physical symptoms are they same different or new symptoms \\s patient: if it like if its if it like starts early at beginning of test to my hearts like pounding at this point but i still have sweaty palms im still like tensing \\s therapist: so it really just gets mentally physically more unpleasant for you \\s patient: mm hmm yeah \\s therapist: so when you just when youre saying panic panics really occurring few items in after you have first one that you thought youve missed \\s patient: mm hmm \\s therapist: this has been happening for while as you described right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well how about your grades how have you actually been doing on quizzes \\s patient: ive been pretty solid b student \\s therapist: umm hmm \\s patient: so i feel i wish i did better i wish i got as but i mean these are fine but when i take this because its not it doesnt i dont know how it translates \\s therapist: about your study habits if you consider yourself effective studying \\s patient: ive tried ive taken workshops on studying ive i i think im pretty effective at studying ive found what doesnt work so i try to study by reading chapter taking outlines reviewing flashcards which has i think best results but \\s therapist: okay so your study habits are good your quiz scores are good but youre still having these distressing thoughts these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take quizzes \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that about right \\s patient: yeah thats absolutely right \\s therapist: so really you dont necessarily need your performance to change you just you just need to your thoughts feelings behaviors to change yeah so how you how youre reacting to quizzes maybe \\s patient: yeah cuz i get bs like i said so yeah \\s therapist: b good \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so alright so i want to take you back to moment when youre looking at first slide lets go back to that for second okay so youre taking quiz youre having those thoughts surrounding first item which will not mistaken automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy go on mac thought that im im not going to get this one right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: or something to that effect \\s patient: right \\s therapist: what does that mean to you \\s patient: it means once i dont get that right im not getting in anything else right okay \\s therapist: alright so with that thought means to you that youre going to miss that item then youre going to miss all rest of it so youre youre going to fail whole quick whole thing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so looking at that almost lets call that an intermediate belief right its more of rule or an expectation right what does that mean to you \\s patient: it just gets worse if i fail quiz then im like oh my god im gonna fail panel i am going to fail course thats gonna affect my gpa \\s therapist: so just keep stacking other other beliefs so youre gonna fail course were gonna fail final rather than then course so few failed course what does that mean to you \\s patient: not going to graduate \\s therapist: youre not going to graduate \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so weve moved from failing quiz if we just look at meaning right to fail on final to fail on course now to not graduating so if you didnt graduate what would that mean to you \\s patient: i cant i cant be teacher i cant do what i want to do \\s therapist: so your chosen location to be teacher would be not possible \\s patient: right \\s therapist: right so we go step further say what would it mean to you if you couldnt be teacher \\s patient: i dont know who id be at that point thats what i always saw as my career so i dont know what my future would look like at that point without that \\s therapist: so if you were to phrase it kind of think back as we to cbt techniques kind of conceptualization uncovered if youre to phrase as an if statement what would you what would you be if you couldnt be teacher what that make you \\s patient: i am person who didnt make it im person that failed like we said earlier \\s therapist: im person who didnt make it im person who failed so in way youre saying im failure \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that close \\s patient: yeah its fine \\s therapist: so remember we talked before about core beliefs how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations like in your case taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so one of your core beliefs may be that that youre failure you may believe that \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: does that seem like something that youve said to yourself before or thought before \\s patient: think about it like that until we did step up to it now but i i can relate to that \\s therapist: mmm hmm \\s patient: because lot of times i do feel like oh im not gonna be able to do this because its me i wont be able to do it \\s therapist: not because its challenging or difficult but something to do with you \\s patient: hmm yeeah \\s therapist: right so thats what i call like youre personalizing \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so youre saying to yourself at variety of levels im going to be unsuccessful im going todoe that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: do you think thats whats happening \\s patient: it must be because like i said i study i got good grades ive been tested years ago i dont have adhd anything intrinsic that would prohibit me \\s therapist: so youre able to focus calm \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well \\s patient: yes i can do all of that but when it comes to it im like i cant do it \\s therapist: so somewhere somewhere this dis core belief its possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are failure unsuccessful \\s patient: i dont think they would see connection i think it would be like well you do well in school i dont understand \\s therapist: so they wouldnt believe that youre failure \\s patient: no \\s therapist: you may believe it \\s patient: yeah i guess yeah \\s therapist: similarly if you had classmate that was in same situation you know struggled with these disturbing thoughts feelings behaviors during quizzes how would you evaluate them \\s patient: i guess id say same thing that my family would say like youre gonna look at evidence youre not failure \\s therapist: you evaluate that they werent failure \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but if it was yourself youre being little more harsh \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: which isnt uncommon \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so theres few levels at which i think we can go after this what ill call problem but really its series of thoughts beliefs okay first that comic at ground level thats when you are taking quiz you have that automatic thought that says im going to miss this item \\s patient: im not going to get it right \\s therapist: yes im not gonna get it right so thats your thought im not going to get it right \\s patient: ahmm hmm \\s therapist: these situations i like to encourage clients to apply whats called an adaptive response or self talk so its its noun if youre in quiz in quiet classroom it wouldnt literally be self taught \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: but its thought that you were consciously applying so other thought thats automatic \\s patient: right \\s therapist: that just pops in your head right \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: this one would be one that you deliberately think \\s patient: make myself \\s therapist: so what could you think to yourself that would be counter to that automatic thought that youre having that youre gonna get that item wrong \\s patient: i guess that in my past quizzes like chances are i i have good chance of getting it right \\s therapist: okay so just looking at probabilities based on your past performance even though im thinking im going to get it wrong \\s patient: right \\s therapist: chances are im going to get it wrong \\s patient: right somehow i still have b so \\s therapist: so you are getting most of them right \\s patient: right so i have good chance \\s therapist: so i like that adaptive response right do you think that makes sense for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i think you did well there so next time youre taking quiz i want you to apply that adaptiv response \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: that this takes work right so this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you then before you know it youre gonna have that feeling \\s patient: yeah right \\s therapist: physical symptoms \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: discuss sweaty palms right feeling of i think you mentioned \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so dont let it discourage you those symptoms come on so quickly \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: right there an intervening thought youve identified it right so you will have an opportunity most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point but first few times it might be little rough \\s patient: yeah testing qa \\s therapist: i guess nice thing about quiz i mean how many items are on these quizzes \\s patient: 15 \\s therapist: so you have few different chances to apply adaptive responses right \\s patient: right its more than one \\s therapist: yeah so you know youd like to get on first time where you have that on i thought we identified on that thought but if you dont no big deal right so you know later on maybe it takes them two or three then you might remember hey i have this \\s patient: yeah oh wait supposed to be thinking that \\s therapist: yeah my hope that as you apply this adaptive response more more you can reduce probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so thats one level that i want you to to go after it does that make sense \\s patient: it does i think i can do that \\s therapist: thats how many feel like you could you could do at other level i guess youd call this deeper level but its all really you know in your brain right its just this core belief \\s patient: right \\s therapist: okay why use word deeper because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn but they dont change as easily \\s patient: right \\s therapist: as automatic thoughts might id like you to this really just more selection reflect on evidence or evaluate evidence that supports refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that youre failure \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: right i think cognitively you kind of understand that youre not right but another sense you feel like you are right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so in way cognitively youre \\s patient: theres that discrepancy \\s therapist: right right theres theres little bit of both \\s patient: mm hmm yeah \\s therapist: you can tell me that your family would say thats not case but you still \\s patient: right on paper technically i would im not but i still i guess feel that way \\s therapist: theres part of you that still feels that way theres part of you that still believes that cognitively theres also part of you that thinks through that says thats thats not accurate \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so i want you to weigh validity of that core belief \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: right actually i think that this helpful to write down evidence that that would support it right thats certainly something to note but also this really more important evidence that refutes it evidence that runs counter \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but record both well meet next time well look at evidence evaluated \\s patient: yeah we can do that \\s therapist: so those two those two steps you feel like youre comfortable with they make sense to you \\s patient: yeah they do yeah i definitely think i can do those \\s therapist: whens next time youll be taking quiz \\s patient: think next week \\s therapist: next week \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay i know how these quizzes oftehn \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so well set up session for next week lets try to get towards after your next quiz \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so well have that to talk about i think thats next area to make it sounds like next area itd be good to try make progress \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: seems like thats what you want to work on \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so well go from there so ill set up an appointment for just to have that quiz tried to adapt response try evaluating evidence quickly \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: does that sound good \\s patient: yes i can do that \\s therapist: all right i will set appointment up i appreciate you coming in working through this \\s patient: yeah thank you so much",

            "patient: okay how are you \\s therapist: good thanks for asking i understand youve come here today to agency because you had recent arrest \\s patient: yeah i got dui for being under influence of alcohol marijuana \\s therapist: alcohol marijuana how recently was this dui about week ago okay so whats been going on when that happened \\s patient: um well i am going to have to go to courtsoon i know that im probably gonna have to go id like treatment or something like that but i really just dont want to so i just im just coming here becausei dont know maybe i can like get out of it if im gettingsome type of treatment but yeah \\s therapist: get out of it you mean get out of charge \\s patient: yeah i mean i feel like theyre probably gonna make me like go to like rehab or something like that i dont want to do that \\s therapist: so you feel like you can get out of rehab or two \\s patient: i dont know i really am not sure \\s therapist: so at this recent arrest you realize it may be value to stop using which really dont want to yeah stuck there \\s patient: yeah kind of \\s therapist: when you drink do you ever socialize same time \\s patient: i mean sometimes ill like go to bars things like that but most of times just like at my house \\s therapist: alone so do marijuana \\s patient: yeah i mean i like few people that are like smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself myself every day so it was with people \\s therapist: so it doesnt sound like youre really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing \\s patient: um this this alcohol i want to take it for pain relief qualities yeah \\s therapist: any other reasons um \\s patient: its just easier \\s therapist: forget about problems yeah so affects your mood in positive way \\s patient: yeah like i get like i like feeling once im drunk \\s therapist: have you use since you had to do it \\s patient: um i havent drank but ive as situation \\s therapist: so you have use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good but then you have these consequences of law you figure those two things out \\s patient: i dont know i dont know if there what was your wealth of knowledge so like not as just \\s therapist: you can imagine that so it was good other side can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in future \\s patient: i guess i hadnt really considered that \\s therapist: so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or theres not really heavy consequence youll be more careful in future \\s patient: i dont know yeah i guess so \\s therapist: so with that thinking you continue to use as you were that you would take out part that got you in trouble \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: first you have to get out of trouble this time \\s patient: yep \\s therapist: so if you could have pain anxiety go away without alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it \\s patient: i just couldnt imagine \\s therapist: so theres social component here \\s patient: yeah little bit i drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like nine five jobs they dont drink every day but i do but like on weekends like all of my friends who i \\s therapist: so even if you had no anxiety no pain youd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them i didnt drink \\s patient: um they probably just like wouldnt understand it because we all go out we get like really drunk \\s therapist: so itd be socially awkward straining relationships with your friends so quitting alcohol marijuana like stopping use that doesnt seem like good route for you \\s patient: know \\s therapist: but then you have this distressing situation which making you second guessed some of it \\s patient: yeah i mean its making me think that like maybe i i need to like make change i just cant see that thats change im making so \\s therapist: you need to make some change yeah but not alcohol drugs \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: something else could change \\s patient: yeah i dont know what but \\s therapist: so you could reduce your usage avoid driving that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop anxiety of pain \\s patient: am i just not going anywhere ever i might not drive as often \\s therapist: so that strategy might not work thats something youve been tossing around though this idea of isolating little bit more drinking little less seems like all your options here kind of grim yeah thats just thats just me doesnt seem that way to you too \\s patient: now that im like \\s therapist: talking through it yeah \\s patient: id like dont think i have any choice really \\s therapist: have any choice whats going to happen going to happen \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: all right so lets start with lead now pick up with me now you dont want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with dui what do you think you could do that would make bad impression \\s patient: um go to court drug \\s therapist: i would do it \\s patient: get another dui in meantime that was not good either \\s therapist: so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you dont want to have sex would it be acceptable those things anyway \\s patient: i mean not really i mean i think i should avoid does not like drunk driving enough or maybe not during day of my court date \\s therapist: so would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations i go in court truck \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: goals that you could get behind \\s patient: i mean i can try i guess to like think about it charlie get out now im gonna be stressed out ate my court date its gonna be hard to like not drink that day \\s therapist: youre not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea \\s patient: now \\s therapist: this really tough for you outcome marriage laws are important yeah this whole this book do you i think its really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed yeah so this an inconvenience that you can move past or this major life with fat that gonna change things \\s patient: i dont know because i dont know any other like way around it then just dealing with it i mean if i like dont go to court or anything thats like worn out for me like i cant i cant avoid this situation \\s therapist: but if theres condition of your treatment judge says no more drinking no more marijuana period we can see that that if you obey those rules or word jail \\s patient: now i couldnt get to that i know it possibly could probably well but i was i dont know \\s therapist: i would think it almost certainly would have happened yeah \\s patient: i dont know what im gonna do \\s therapist: back couple of steps how long have you been using alcohol marijuana \\s patient: for about like six years six years \\s therapist: have you ever until now with dui have you ever envisioned stopping now whats your plan like pre d why was your plan all this \\s patient: i just had dinner like jerking kind of has gotten worse \\s therapist: yeah so without this or something you would have continued using \\s patient: yeah i didnt really have any like \\s therapist: until now yeah could this be strange way like an opportunity \\s patient: i mean i guess if i had if i wanted to stop by this would be way for me to stop or reason for me to stop \\s therapist: if you really wanted to stop because your stuff \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: you could give shot youre just not sure you could you could actually do it \\s patient: yeah i mean ive never tried to before so i dont know \\s therapist: its just unknown \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so where do you want to go from here you have this to you i imagine hearing or some type of coming up here to see me what can i do to help you \\s patient: um \\s therapist: like like place in terms of your thinking like your mentality \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay you want to work on that yeah so between now im gonna see you again do you have any hearings or anything coming up now theyre not for like few more weeks few weeks so ill see you again i have iep everything here second week lets pick up with that they think changes were hearing moved up to slumping okay okay \\s patient: thanks for helping \\s therapist: thank you",

yeah not wanting to be part of group \\s patient: yeah kind of \\s therapist: okay great all right well one of things i want to talk about you know you mentioned that you like to go out with friends party that sort of thing im curious when youre at parties do you ever have any alcohol \\s patient: umm not much maybe like one or two drinks at most \\s therapist: okay can you tell me little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene \\s patient: i pretty much just have drink to just have it like so it looks like im drinking even though im not so maybe people bug me about drinking or something \\s therapist: okay youre kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking it feels easier for you to hold drink \\s patient: have one there pretend you have it \\s therapist: okay do you think that this most weekends or occasionally how often do you think that you are take alchohal \\s patient: one or two weekends month most no really much \\s therapist: so one or two weekends month youre in situation where there alcohol \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay what sort of situations are you in \\s patient: well just i guess at party or something someones house or even if its not party like small social gathering maybe therell be like few beers around \\s therapist: so mainly just kind of hanging out with friends \\s patient: pretty much yeah \\s therapist: are you ever places where there are parents around or mostly just just with kids \\s patient: mostly just with us but sometimes ill go to like close friends house like im close to your family as well so well just hang out \\s therapist: what about driving \\s patient: like drunk driving \\s therapist: yeah do you ever go anywhere in car after youve had alcohol \\s patient: definitely no ive never drunk driven ive never been in car with drunk driver \\s therapist: so thats something that you sort of made decision about \\s patient: because i know thats extremely dangerous \\s therapist: okay what do you know about how thats dangerous \\s patient: well alcohol definitely impairs your judgment so i mean driving under influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes accidents things like that so i rather not be in that situation \\s therapist: so youre really trying to be safe make sure that youre not putting yourself into situations \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: thats great you know its its tough to do sometimes i really commend you for being able to stick with that \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so you mentioned you pretty much will like hold drink or maybe have drink or two what do you thinks most alcohol youve ever had in one day \\s patient: no more than two drinks \\s therapist: okay so absolute most \\s patient: yeah those two \\s therapist: okay what kinds of things do you like about alcohol \\s patient: um ive never really been drunk so i cant really say that i like that feeling or not but its just i mean youre just in good mood \\s therapist: mm hmm so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed \\s patient: yeah relax \\s therapist: okay anything else \\s patient: um no not really like i said i dont drink that much so i wouldnt be able to tell you \\s therapist: okay i mean not so good things about alcohol \\s patient: um definitely yeah i mean when im at parties stuff its getting little later some people that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or theyre really loud obnoxious thats not fun for anybody \\s therapist: so youve seen lot of other kids yeah had some consequences decided thats not for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i got it i can understand that any other things that you can think of \\s patient: no i mean ive never you know been friends with anybody its gotten to like serious accident so its just very like obnoxious thing \\s therapist: okay well so you know as someone whos not 21 yet it underage drinking something thats not legal it something that considered pretty risky so im wondering what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life \\s patient: um i know its definitely risky i mean i guess we still do it \\s therapist: so its kind of something that its just there \\s patient: yeah its just there \\s therapist: okay im curious you mentioned you know your friends are important to you your familys important in sort of fitting in important to you how does alcohol play role with that \\s patient: um well definitely not in my family life because my parents dont really condone okay alcohol use but friendships i mean when im hanging out with my friends or were at party or something theres usually alcohol involved \\s therapist: okay so from your family perspective that drinking not something that fits very well \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: with friends you feel like its easier to to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldnt have as much fun or your friends wouldnt like you as much \\s patient: i guess it means this just there \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: so it ties in with whole belonging \\s therapist: well when you think about your drinking sort of looking forward five years or 10 years how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life \\s patient: it probably will have very small role if any in my life considering i have big plans for my future \\s therapist: okay can you expand on that little bit more what do you mean \\s patient: i mean i dont think i would be you know drinking as much or going to parties as much if im studying for school or in college or trying to get off school things like that \\s therapist: okay so alcohol something that might make it harder to reach your goals \\s patient: yeah definitely \\s therapist: so when youre sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college \\s patient: maybe less than i am now i mean i dont drink much anyway so maybe like one drink every once in blue moon \\s therapist: okay so you sort of have plan to cut back on your drinking eventually \\s patient: yeah definately \\s therapist: how might that go \\s patient: well i mean i guess right now i would try to stop in high school once i get older maybe just like socially once in while but not anything bigger \\s therapist: yeah so you dont feel need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make some adjustments \\s patient: yeah definately thats good thing \\s therapist: okay how important it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on scale of 1 to 10 where one not at all important not something youre thinking about 10 most important thing \\s patient: maybe five or six \\s therapist: why did you say five or six rather than like two or three \\s patient: because its not something i do not care about it all but its not something thats just constantly on my mind that i want to change about myself \\s therapist: okay so it something you have thought about \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how confident are you that you could make change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale \\s patient: im pretty confident that i can considering that im not really an alcohol user per se im not really into that whole scene so its gonna be difficult for me \\s therapist: so what number do you think youd say \\s patient: on scale of one to 10 if i can quit alchohol \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: maybe like an eight or nine \\s therapist: okay all right well kind of keeping that in mind it sounds like you do have sort of vague plan to make some adjustments youre drinking at some point \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: its moderately important to you its something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it what sort of gold do you think might be good to set for today \\s patient: um probably to stop maybe next friday i go to i have drink at all \\s therapist: okay do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely \\s patient: yeah i mean i can just tell my friends my parent my friends arent really that pressuring its just like outside people that dont really know that well so i could just tell them hey i dont feel like having drink today \\s therapist: but what might be some benefits of following through with that goal \\s patient: definitely ill have like all my senses there ill be aware of everything thats going on \\s therapist: uh huh anything else \\s patient: um health concerns i guess i know alcohol bad for your health so that would be one \\s therapist: okay so its it sounds like youre actually pretty comfortable with setting goal of not drinking anymore at least at next party seeing how it goes \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes see if working out for you \\s patient: yeah that would be okay \\s therapist: all right great then it sounds like some of benefits youre expecting are health benefits having an easier time with achieving your academic career goals just sort of not having to deal with some of consequences that your peers do \\s patient: right \\s therapist: okay well very good there anything else that you think would be important for me to know \\s patient: how would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking \\s therapist: oh thats great question so lot of times kids who are trying to cut back its harder if their friends are still drinking one of easiest things trying to have more activities that dont involve alcohol but of course thats harder if youre not doing planning so some of things that can be useful if youre at party say theres already alcohol there there are other kids that maybe arent your closest friends some of things that i would recommend since youre interested are you know carrying around different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having mixed drink just having coke say without any alcohol mixed into it often having anything in your hand good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there do you think any of those things might work for you \\s patient: yeah for sure \\s therapist: okay what about in terms of talking to your friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or that something else youd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking \\s patient: i was just planning on playing them that i dont really want to drink anymore that was me know \\s therapist: your friends would be pretty comfortable with that \\s patient: yeah i mean that was my closest friends for sure \\s therapist: okay great any other concerns or questions anything else i go \\s patient: no i think okay \\s therapist: okay so then like i said ill try see if we can meet up maybe in few weeks see how its going then if things are going great then fantastic if you run into any stumbling blocks we can maybe problem solve together \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: that okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right thanks so much \\s patient: no problem",

            "therapist: hi ann how are you doing today \\s patient: i guess im okay how are you \\s therapist: im well thanks for asking so you sau you doing okay whats going on \\s patient: im definitely no better than last week when we talked i mean its been i had some major binges this week i dont even honestly know why were bothering to talk about it because ive been down this road before \\s therapist: umm hmm \\s patient: i should just i should just like give up buy some momos you know just resign myself to pack im going to get fat im going to stay bad \\s therapist: tell me about some of foods that youve been eating that have been kind of leading to this problem for you \\s patient: brownies brownies brownies brownies well thats what got it started you know i was great first half of week of staying away from sugar away from flour i signed stay at home from school you know hurt his head he wanted to bake brownies with my son okay lets bake brownies so then we eat whole pan we bake two more pans then it didnt just stay brownies you know went out like hamburgers french fries candy you know stopped in wah wah on way up its disgusting i cant i didnt want to tell you how because its disgusting clothes arent fitting its just really really sad \\s therapist: youve had rough week \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so lets talk about for second id like to kind of your relationship to this problem how do you how do you view this problem \\s patient: its disgusting its like its slavery food owns me \\s therapist: so so food in control of this situation \\s patient: sounds ridiculous when you say it like that but thats what it \\s therapist: its in control \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: alright so now i want to ask you couple of questions about importance confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or we wouldnt be be here \\s patient: oh my god i would love to yeah \\s therapist: so if youre looking at scale of one to 10 one was its not important to change 10 was extremely important change this just how important it for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you \\s patient: yeah its very important \\s therapist: very important okay so what if i asked same question except this time youre confidence so one youre not confident all you can change but 10 youre very confident you could change \\s patient: i could probably change for half day ive done it sometimes if im lucky ill get week but overall \\s therapist: overall yeah \\s patient: its impossible like you want number at zero \\s therapist: so its below below scale of one to 10 this \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so you can have no confidence at all \\s patient: ive tried it i know i mean its like beating my head against wall \\s therapist: so on one hand youd like to youd like to stop eating its important to but on other hand you dont believe you can do it \\s patient: i cant do it \\s therapist: you cant do it \\s patient: i cant \\s therapist: it cant be done have there been any other changes you have been able to make say in last few years that have been positive \\s patient: i stopped biting my nails \\s therapist: so you had some small successes in terms of making changes \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: what do you think makes this thought ill just refer to as food problem so much more powerful so much more difficult to tackle \\s patient: i wish i know i mean theres so many things its its everywhere \\s therapist: food everywhere \\s patient: it everywhere i mean \\s therapist: you mentioned before that brownies were culprit for this last week \\s patient: brownies hershey bars hershey kisses yeah chocolate \\s therapist: you enjoy chocolate \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay how about other foods that could be contributing problem maybe you dont enjoy as much as chocolate \\s patient: oh potato chips french fries mexican food what else cheese \\s therapist: definitely any of types of candies \\s patient: start naming skittles cherry starburst basically any candy \\s therapist: pretty much any candy \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so of candy so i want to focus just on candies okay not to foods just for now thought of like i introduced idea of stopping eating chocolate how would you react to that \\s patient: not gonna happen \\s therapist: thats not gonna happen all right \\s patient: i would love for it to happen \\s therapist: right but thats not gonna happen \\s patient: i can just tell you i dont even want to pretend \\s therapist: so you know that for sure how about lets lets go for example with skittles what if i introduce idea of stopping consumption of skittles \\s patient: just candy skittles \\s therapist: just just that one candy yeah \\s patient: why bother that like can i not eat skittles that what youre saying like \\s therapist: you could its up to you whether or not but if i introduced that idea of stopping consumption of skittles how would you react to that \\s patient: i dont really understand why \\s therapist: well it represents change in direction that you want to move \\s patient: but if i stopped eating skittles im still going to eat brownies im still going to eat yeah \\s therapist: we know we know that scenario that you know you cant really make change right now from what youre saying like thats idea of stuffing chocolate not going over well with you \\s patient: no its not gonna happen \\s therapist: thats fine but idea of stopping skittles \\s patient: its fine \\s therapist: that doesnt seem as daunting \\s patient: no \\s therapist: would you agree still on say 110 scale that its important to stop skittles \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how confident are you you could not eat \\s patient: its kind of funny now youre talking about it ive sort of wants skittles more but you know i like from now till next week when i come in here id say like i am 99 confident i could not eat skittles it would not be major problem \\s therapist: so this change that you think you could accomplish \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: even though youre not sure itll actually contribute to solving larger problem we know that thats something that thats an area where you dont really see change as as likely \\s patient: if i dont eat skittles this week or even for rest of my life it going to solve my problem no but will i do it if thats what you want me to do yeah thats fine \\s therapist: well i would hope its something that that you would want to do i mean what i want one thing what you want really important here this something that mean your skittles part of problem \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: small \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: alrigh no pun intended right but its small part of problem but youd agree its still part of problem \\s patient: yeah sure \\s therapist: not huge change but its one that we can work on \\s patient: alright \\s therapist: we want you to be able to you know genuinely buy into goal i mean if you dont think its important we can talk about other areas of change \\s patient: no i guess i see what youre saying i mean if im gonna be completely honest with you i well thats what im paying you for right so i dont think its gonna work ill just tell you that \\s therapist: right you think you could stop eating skittles but you dont think its gonna solve larger problem or lead to \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: but thats what we have to work with right now because larger problem not something you mean way you put it it has control \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so if i introduced idea of stopping brownies \\s patient: no no no sorry \\s therapist: so lets lets go after change that we can achieve in this case you know its not perfect its not ideal but its what you can do you saw plan so suffer so for this week so you can week for this week just just continue eating skittles \\s patient: now skittles alright \\s therapist: lets see lets see how we do with that change \\s patient: so that seemed to make sense \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: so work with that ill see you again week \\s therapist: thanks \\s patient: thank you",

            "therapist: hello peggy how you doing today \\s patient: im okay \\s therapist: youre okay glad to hear that yesterday when youre here at agency you took few different tests remember that \\s patient: i did \\s therapist: one of tests you took called scl 90 symptom checklist 90 do you remember taking that test \\s patient: i think so \\s therapist: its 90 items they are ranked \\s patient: asked me like true false questions \\s therapist: not true false are numbers that you solve \\s patient: oh okay i do remember that okay \\s therapist: so i have results from that test i want to review some of those findings with you \\s patient: okay all right sure \\s therapist: so this particular instrument has number of what we refer to as sub scales so these are areas that are measured by instrument right for example depression or anxiety so im going to review few of these sub scales ones where you scored little higher than we might expect just review those with you see see what youre thinking we can talk about \\s patient: okay are you recording this \\s therapist: no \\s patient: are very worried about that \\s therapist: it what makes you think im recording \\s patient: because that happens to me lot \\s therapist: it happens to you lot that you get recorded \\s patient: i think so yeah yeah \\s therapist: remember last time it happened \\s patient: you probably yesterday \\s therapist: you think you were recorded while youre taking this \\s patient: probably yeah \\s therapist: that sounds worrisome thats thats feeling you get lot that youre being recorded \\s patient: i worry about it lot \\s therapist: you worry about it lot \\s patient: but you know its happening thats why i worry about it \\s therapist: youre certain thats happening \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: where youre not being recorded now i know it probably feels like you are but youre not okay \\s patient: okay but i appreciate you bringing up that concern with me i think so in school \\s therapist: in school right i that would make sense so say for instance you had percentile rank of 65 right percentile that would mean that your score equal to or higher than 65 of people that took that test okay so that makes sense so if you took test on math or english you would say 75 percentile youd be higher than three quarters of people took test 75 okay understand does that make sense i think so okay if you want me to come back to that later just let me know as i go through if it doesnt make sense okay so areas here on on scl results or you were bit higher than we would normally see one phobic anxiety scale on that one you were about 64 percentile so your score was as high or higher than 64 of people who take it \\s patient: to more than half people in population \\s therapist: more than half number half people in same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment \\s patient: so i have more phobic anxiety than most people \\s therapist: it does seem that way yeah so this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out being afraid of being crowds does that connect with you that seem like fear that you have \\s patient: yeah okay \\s therapist: tell me about that \\s patient: i dont like being on public transportation hmm crowds make me nervous if i ever have to public speak i feel like im just going to pass out \\s therapist: so it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms so that that score today that 64 percentile that kind of makes sense \\s patient: i kind of get that \\s therapist: i want to move on to next one which paranoia on this one you were at 84th percentile so quite bit higher \\s patient: that why you were recording me \\s therapist: but this this wasnt recorded nothing was recorded here understand thats worry that you have \\s patient: are you going to share those results with anybody \\s therapist: in your particular case only people will be shared with this rest of treatment team anybody that you sign release for \\s patient: but if government asks you youd have to give them those results \\s therapist: theres no reason right now i did that there are certain limits to confidentiality but in your situation here at this clinic theres no reason i would share this information with government or or anybody else other than people indicated so rest of people here to treat you if you wanted to release results to somebody you could sign release i would let them have results \\s patient: well im worried that i know people are recording me i think that that results shows that i know thats happening now you want to make it look like that means i have problem when im just reporting what i know true \\s therapist: well i assume youre worried that \\s patient: no i think that i know these things are happening but this test says that im wrong to think that it makes me paranoid \\s therapist: oh i understand okay so these things are really happening yeah right but test arranged so that its making it look paranoid when youre not exactly \\s patient: exactly okay \\s therapist: so that would explain why your score elevated on scale okay that that what youre thinking \\s patient: i do yeah \\s therapist: i wanted you to know that i appreciate you telling me that do you think its possible that its working other way around that test measuring something that actually there \\s patient: no i dont think so \\s therapist: you dont think so okay \\s patient: i understand that im higher than most people \\s therapist: you believe their situation different than yours okay i understand so last area last subscale i want to discuss this one global scale on discuss glass subscale one thats referred to as psychoticism there you are at 93rd percentile thats when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people dont see or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside norm cant be supported by evidence they feel like thats happening to you \\s patient: are you going to put me away \\s therapist: theres theres nothing here that would indicate that im gonna put you away or center anywhere yeah i just really this purpose of this just to discuss results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you like so were gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results \\s patient: sometimes i hear things other people dont hear \\s therapist: okay so this this score that makes makes sense to retake test might be right \\s patient: maybe thats true maybe thats true okay but i am being recorded \\s therapist: but you believe youre being recorded youre starting to that \\s patient: close to normal \\s therapist: well little bit higher than we want to see \\s patient: me i dont like to go out much \\s therapist: so at paranoid if that if that scale was accurate in your estimation your global severity might be lower i think yeah closer to 50 percentile i think so even if you were closer to 50 percentile you can to understand how were concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that sure that okay \\s patient: it okay \\s therapist: so i will meet with counselor that will be treating youre here im going to go over these scores now explain to her what youve explained to me okay in terms of why you think you might have received score okay ill go over that with her of course you could discuss it with her too shell have results of this test in your chart \\s patient: okay okay shes not going to record our session \\s therapist: she shes not going to be recording okay \\s patient: it does \\s therapist: okay i appreciate you allow me to go over this set of results with you im going to show you assigned to that counselor well move forward with treatment \\s patient: okay thank thanks peggy",
            "The therapist is reviewing the findings of SCL 90 test where the sub scales are little higher than expected. The patient is worried if the session is recorded and is assured by the therapist that it is not. The therapist highlights the patient scored 64 percentile on phobic anxiety symptoms. The patient agrees they don't like public transportations, crowds make them nervous, and they can't speak publicly. Next, the therapist says the patient has scored 84 percentile on paranoia. The patient argues that they know they are being recorded which is a fact and stating that makes the test to be true about paranoia about them which is not exactly. The patient still agrees they can be higher than most people for paranoia but not that high. The patient asks if these results be shared with the government for which the therapist clarifies it will only be shared with the treatment team. The last thing therapist highlights from the test is psychoticism in whcih they scored 93 percentile. The patient agrees that they do hear things that other's don't. The patient continues to express discomfort that they are being recorded. The therapist assured to setup the patient with a counselor and share the results with them. "

            "therapist: hi hazel how are you doing today \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: whats been going on \\s patient: well last time i started to tell you little bit about one of my friends my best friend actually she had this issue so what happened was she went to bathroom at our local library she found video camera when she was going to bathroom \\s therapist: in bathroom \\s patient: yeah she actually yeah she turned it into police i guess because like she carried it or she had found it her hand prints were on it they werent able to they werent able to detect who actually did it they werent able to catch \\s therapist: probably didnt catch person \\s patient: no so send then ive been on really just high alert like im worried that that could happen to me to my kids im just really worried because they didnt catch guy that him or someone like him could be out there \\s therapist: so hes still out in community right so how it affecting your your daily life can you tell me kind of what your where youve been feeling \\s patient: lot of anxiety just not knowing maybe you know what if someone were to videotape me like that ive been very aware shall i say of cameras \\s therapist: okay so anxious aware \\s patient: right like i know you have one in your office people on their cell phone cameras \\s therapist: right \\s patient: just all possibilities that i could be recorded ive just been very aware of them which makes me not want to go anywhere so ive been having arguing with my husband lot because he wants to go out to restaurants i dont want to go because there could be cameras in bathrooms how i dress also as you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because i remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be you you know use in creepy way so i i cant you know its now almost summertime i cant dress skirt or be comfortable because im dressing like that \\s therapist: so you have covered lot of ground there so you have you have feeling of being like worried nervous whether thats gonna happen to you but youve also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer \\s patient: right \\s therapist: has that helped has has changed in way you dressed or changing where you go when you go that help reduce anxiety \\s patient: not really no i would say its really starting thats why i wanted to come in its really starting to affect my life \\s therapist: you mentioned specifically your husband has like whats been going on here \\s patient: he just wants to go places with our kids like go out to eat i dont really want to go anywhere that because you know cameras are everywhere nowadays \\s therapist: they are \\s patient: i just kind of worried like public bathrooms could they be there someone being you know sometimes baby monitors or you know have two phones people can hack into that laptop cameras so even in my own house ive just been really nervous so i feel like im not really getting relief from that anxiety \\s therapist: have you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry \\s patient: i mean ive read \\s therapist: i was already mentioned like with camera specifically i mean \\s patient: ive um you know when i go into bathrooms i ive been looking for cameras to make sure they werent there before you know me or my children that needs bathroom i have tried i read online you can learn how to turn off cameras on your phone that you can close your laptop in that way camera will face down so same thing on smart tv so it doesnt recognize your face ive ive tried to turn things off they dont need to be on as far as people being able to access myown information \\s therapist: that seems reasonable once you take reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded \\s patient: right \\s therapist: against your will \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: but still you have this feeling of worry anxiety your your schedules being interfered with \\s patient: right \\s therapist: skewed youd like to cope more effectively with your feelings reduces anxiety so when you enter into public bathroom we talked about automatic thoughts before those thoughts it just kind of pop into our head they connect to feelings that can be unpleasant \\s patient: right \\s therapist: like anxiety worry so when you walk into public restroom whats first thing that goes through your mind \\s patient: that there might be video camera that i dont see that thats maybe like with my friend that was big enough but i might not catch it in that someones going to use that in vulgar way \\s therapist: okay so when you walk in youre wondering if theres camera there \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: when that automatic thought occurs what follows that in terms of feeling or behavior \\s patient: usually ill try find camera but its usually anxiety fear my heart rate starts going up i start getting really anxious then you know i try either rush to use bathroom if i really have to go or lot of times if i dont ill just leave sometimes i try use bathroom at home so i dont have to go out \\s therapist: so you behaviors looking for camera or sometimes just leaving without using restroom youre youre feeling that that anxiety worry there \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: weve been talking about okay so really if we think about we talked before about core beliefs intermediate beliefs wonder if intermediate belief isnt it im vulnerable or this more specifically maybe its more of core belief more specifically im vulnerable in this area like put this guy on loose \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you know committed that crime then you know thats combining with situations that you encounter thats where youre getting those automatic thoughts so that sort of makes sense \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: okay so you remember what what in terms of kind of therapy youd like to apply what we call adaptive response or self talk so its that thought that you interject at that moment you realize youre having an automatic thought thats going to be to in this case anxiety worry behaviors that are looking for camera isnt maybe useful behavior but leaving you know thats that that could certainly be on useful behavior so in terms of that self talk lets lets work to develop self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial you know i wonder if theres camera in this bathroom right what do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought feelings youre having \\s patient: i could say if when i walked in bathroom \\s therapist: umm hmm \\s patient: maybe i could say umm you know while there could be chance that theres camera in this bathroom chance of it happening not very likely you know im gonna take steps to keep myself safe so that i wont be in vulnerable position such as looking for camera \\s therapist: but its good so you have you have low probability of it happening youre taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further \\s patient: right \\s therapist: right so thats good automatic thought i think are good adaptive response for next thought rather why dont you why dont you try that one out right next time you had that on that thought right try out that you know i think thats really you know thats logical i mean its its unlikely to happen of course theres chance right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: we we acknowledge that in self talk theres chance that it could happen but theres precautions you can take thats low chance sometimes as well so keep that on mac thought well review it in end \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: right before you leave today well write these down but thats thats one adaptive response rather that i want to write down for you i also want to talk about like worst case scenario because right now you have anxiety worry about an event that while its unlikely it could happen it could happen im wondering how you think you would react if it worst did happen if you if you use restroom you found out through law enforcement or by finding camera that an offender had been you know watching you right on recording how would react to that \\s patient: i mean i think i would be really upset i think i would feel vulnerable probably for while be hesitant i mean i would think ultimately that would be okay my friend happened while ago shes starting to get to get over it get back to her usual routine although shes still hesitant so i think i would be okay eventually although id be really upset that it happened \\s therapist: it would make sense to feel upset but that would be upsetting for anybody but as you noted that would probably be relatively temporary \\s patient: thats right \\s therapist: distress right well acute certainly you wouldnt be happy about it it shouldnt be happy about it \\s patient: right \\s therapist: it would probably go away i learned to adapt how long have you been in state of anxiety worry \\s patient: probably it happened like two months two months \\s therapist: how many days average week are you affected by these feelings \\s patient: every day \\s therapist: every day \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so if we can compare it right we have chance to be recorded right illegally thats low probability event it could happen probably not likely anxiety worry that youre having thats high probability event because youre suffering from every day \\s patient: thats true i never thought about it that way \\s therapist: so theres theres point at which maybe you reach you say id rather take that route to take risk id rather deal with potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded face that if it happens then be in state of anxiety worry \\s patient: right because right now im suffering every day \\s therapist: now youre suffering right if if you could adaptively respond effectively you youre still gonna have that risk of being recorded but you know you could survive that event if it happened late \\s patient: i can get it \\s therapist: youre taking reasonable cautions you know things we talked about so as you think about this in more general sense there adaptive response you could apply it to that to that on that thought of you know i need to be worried about this or you know whatever that thought looks like sometimes thoughts in image rights may like an image have been recorded but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of house what adapter response could you apply there \\s patient: maybe you know like i said im worried about all cameras maybe i could say you know i understand theres some cameras that you know use for good purposes security \\s therapist: probably most are \\s patient: right chances of being recorded illegally are not likely if im taking precautions to you know go to right places good areas good areas so its not likely to happen overall me going outside house worth risk you know minimal risk that it would happen if it did happen i could survive \\s therapist: thats great thats great adaptive yeah actually thats kind of few adaptive responses \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: but thats good you can you can apply them well well kind of break them down \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: like i said before you leave today well break those down so you can you could have written down as you go out i think its important because automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly its important to rehearse these adaptive responses so were ready to go \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: right kind of you know were being were preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response in order to be prepared you you have to know what it so its good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so before we leave today ill take care of that i want you to use as adaptive responses for this week ill see you next week record what outcome was every time youre able to apply response that includes what you felt what you actually did \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: of course as you mentioned any physiological reactions like your heart racing right underneath that so thats really that sub behavior but note both physiological behaviors other behaviors \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: yeah once youre consciously controlling then any feelings okay well go through them well go through each time use it one by one they have there are kind of see if we need to adjust adaptive response see how well its working okay thats plan \\s patient: yeah i think that will be helpful \\s therapist: so well go from there i appreciate you coming in today \\s patient: thank you very much \\s therapist: thanks",

patient: i need to yeah yeah \\s therapist: what do you have in mind \\s patient: i just keep thinking about you know losing this weight i just really want to do it i just i just cant get there i dont know why too frustrated its ridiculous \\s therapist: frustated trying to lose weight now youd said before that you had specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose you still have that in mind \\s patient: i would like 20 pounds 20 pounds i mean i would like more but i ive tried to do more in past i dont even get past couple of days so i can do 20 that would be great \\s therapist: right you tried before what do you think got in way \\s patient: i dont know i guess it wasnt convenient you know \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: just like something always gets in way you know then i lose focus im not very good at staying focused on stuff like that \\s therapist: loss of focus so you start trying to lose weight your focus gets disrupted \\s patient: i forget then i make you know spaghetti casserole for six people then i eat lot of it thats carbs cheese fat then i you know will eat with my kids dont eat then its just like i forget that im supposed to be making healthy choices \\s therapist: alright so you know how to lose weight you know you can lose weight but your focus little off when youre trying thats causing problem could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units like say five pounds \\s patient: do you think \\s therapist: its just something you can do \\s patient: i am so busy \\s therapist: for once week \\s patient: i probably do once week \\s therapist: you mentioned loss of focus one problem how about motivation you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds five pounds so on \\s patient: right now yes i think i would need something to keep me going you know week to week \\s therapist: little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated \\s patient: yeah like when your kid does their homework early you can give them special treat for dessert like that helps you know keep it going \\s therapist: okay so some sort of activity or item that you enjoy that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that first five pounds \\s patient: i would love i mean ive just been so embarrassed you know \\s therapist: all right do you have activity or item in mind we could put in place as something you could reward yourself with \\s patient: like after first five pounds \\s therapist: well theres few ways we could do it we could do that so you reach five pounds then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day if that day youre successful in eating way you want he would you think would motivate you more \\s patient: maybe something every day \\s therapist: yes you know each every day as youre trying to lose weight youre aware when that day comes to close if you had successful night they were less than successful day right if you have successful day then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that you know would motivate youright \\s patient: that could be you know maybe watching like favorite tv show okay you know because i dont watch tv at night because im so busy cleaning up everything maybe i could just take some time for myself because i did something good you know i just watch tv show \\s therapist: so lets lets do that on day you know towards evening when you know you have had successful day by what time would you know in evening \\s patient: probably as im preparing dinner if i prepare food dinner or if i prepare fun food for my kids but i dont eat it like chicken nuggets french fries stuff \\s therapist: lets say some okay say so by 7pm at that point in terms of day being successful or less than successful you know okay right at 7pm youre aware at that point if you have met your call then you have you have tv show that you maybe its recorded on tv or something you would watch okay if you were not as successful you would write so id be like something to keep you motivated about day because you really want to watch that show right lot of fun do you think that structure that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days so its process \\s patient: i dont know honestly but it would probably be way right now \\s therapist: this something you could also track right you could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful we could look at if theres any patterns maybe weekends are harder because theyre easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or were less motivated \\s patient: yeah i didnt think about that because right every day would be different \\s therapist: okay theres potential for every day to be different with what youre exposed to what temptations in terms of different foods what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier so we can we can look at those different patterns we can add levels to this plan okay but for now well go with tv show that youll watch sometime after seven seven you evaluate how you did sometime after that watch show okay thats like plan \\s patient: so thats leading up to five pounds right right okay \\s therapist: day by day okay this five pound increments okay four times to get to your goal 20 pounds okay sounds good so far so well give that shot well take look at pattern that emerges support everything i say write everything down okay probably at around seven good time when you know kind of day ahead write down kind of what happened that day whether youve had success or not bring that in ill see you again week so give us ill give you seven seven days to work with okay well look at that log of events well reevaluate each week \\s patient: so i could start tonight \\s therapist: starts tonight okay \\s patient: all right \\s therapist: so well give that shot ill see it week \\s patient: okay thanks kevin",

productivity \\s patient: yeah yeah it definitely it its one of those things that like \\s patient: you know has it gives me bad \\s patient: bad evaluation you know like if im not in my stuff in in time number reflects negatively on me you know its its all kind of shes shes first level you know then all other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time so she doesnt then i dont then next person so forth it makes it seem \\s patient: like youre not doing her job \\s patient: right yeah my boss doesnt like it my bosss boss doesnt like so forth you know i try to explain them you know shes problem but it doesnt always i dont always have time to go up tell them like heres whats happening or just somehow it doesnt now \\s therapist: you dont always get opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about situation \\s patient: yeah thats pretty annoying too because \\s patient: you know its one thing if people get mad at me but then im able to tell them why im not doing my job like im supposed to but its another thing for them to get mad at me not realizing its not my fault \\s therapist: you know you have an explanation for why that works \\s patient: yeah i do i do thats thing but i cant always get it out you know i can always tell person thats has complaint about yeah i mean ive tried talking to my my boss ive tried talking other people too you

ask i tried to kind of gently reminding her you know like such such needs to be turned in by tuesday at 12 oclock i didnt want to be real abrasive you know but i i tried to remind him as polite approach yeah yeah it didnt didnt really seem to work because its still happening you know \\s therapist: your attempt to fix problem hasnt really worked way you want \\s patient: it really hasnt thats just i feel like ive tried everything that i could try \\s patient: you know even like i came home i \\s patient: was talking to friend about it \\s patient: i was trying to think of other solutions right you know i was trying to think like what else i could do what else i could say who else i could talk to things like that you know my friend you know you he was listening stuff he had some good suggestions but he didnt know what to do either like cuz he doesnt know way company works \\s patient: so like i got nothing youre not getting help you need for this \\s patient: yeah not at all feeling pretty lost with it i wish there was just like \\s patient: clear way to do things like this what you should do now i dont see anything some \\s therapist: sort of clear plan \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s patient: but yeah i dont \\s patient: i dont see way to go about it i mean ive so ive okay so this way i laid out in my mind i tried talking to people above me didnt work out way i thought it would i tried talking to people below me so to speak just lower on before me in process thats what i mean that didnt work out which just jill i talked to her that didnt work \\s patient: so like theres nowhere else i could turn \\s therapist: options are exhausted \\s patient: yeah thats what it seems like to me \\s therapist: this frustrating for you \\s patient: yeah it ive been trying to wrack my brain you know like what else could i do you know like maybe if i could maybe if there was like committee or something that i could go to you know be like well this persons not doing what theyre supposed to be doing but theres not committee like that or even if there was like person you know like resolution person or whatever but theres nobody like that \\s therapist: theres no other avenue \\s patient: it sort of seems like to me yeah i mean thats \\s patient: you know as im even trying to think like \\s patient: i dont know should i write letter to somebody maybe but i dont even know who or what \\s therapist: you thought about letter \\s therapist: but who would you send it to \\s patient: yeah \\s patient: or like just something else that i can i can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didnt work \\s patient: can i can i \\s patient: call somebody there anybody else in company that you know might handle stuff like that but i mean theres theres hr people but \\s patient: i cant really see where they could come in i dont know how human resources could deal with something like that \\s therapist: you dont view them as potential solution \\s patient: no i dont \\s patient: wondering if theres like \\s patient: but theres i mean im thinking now that theres gotta be something or somebody or somewhere that i could put in like almost like complaint or something like somethings out of my hands i dont know what to do about it but theres got to be something now that im saying this im thinking that theres got to be \\s therapist: some other resource you havent tried yet \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s patient: i mean now im trying to think back to my training you know initially \\s patient: you know maybe theres you know what i think now that im now that im thinking little bit harder about little bit differently about it im thinking that theres like man i forget what they call it now but maybe like complaint but its not right word but maybe complaint box or like suggestions or something i think if i remember correctly those suggestions those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting which we have like every other week \\s therapist: theyre discussed at this regular meeting \\s patient: yeah im thinking now i mean nobody really uses it but im thinking like maybe thats an avenue that i can use you know like maybe thatll get brought up maybe thats something that that might actually work \\s therapist: this could be another option for you \\s patient: yeah it could be then if it does work itll get brought rather if they do read it itll get brought up at staff meeting where everybodys at my boss my bosss boss jill everybodys there maybe thats way for it to come to most attention that deadlines being missed affect other people in ways that you dont really know about \\s therapist: so everyone will hear your complaint \\s therapist: maybe react in way to help you maybe \\s patient: yeah i think thats i mean thats gotta be way to do it maybe thats best way i really think yeah i mean after saying all that after going through that i really think that thats probably best way to do it if it doesnt then i guess i can find another way but i really think thats best way to do it \\s therapist: you feel as though you found an option here \\s patient: yeah yeah even if that doesnt work then itll be brought up maybe itll allow me to talk to my boss further about it maybe ill understand really where im coming from but this will at least be start to something you know to make me lot less stressed with deadlines stuff in \\s therapist: your first started with all this \\s patient: yeah but maybe maybe after i do that you know put in complaint or suggestion \\s patient: maybe i wont be as frustrated \\s patient: i mean im feeling little less frustrated now even thinking if there another option \\s therapist: it feels better now as youre contemplating another potential avenue here \\s patient: yeah yeah thats \\s therapist: well this might be good place to wrap this session up \\s patient: that feels like right \\s therapist: move for you yeah well schedule see you next week we can pick up from there sounds good all right cool next car thank you",
            "The patient has an issue with their co worker who has not been doing their paperwork for the past couple of weeks. This annoys the patient and affects their efficiency in work productivity. The co worker is first in line and it affects everyone's work which their boss doesn't like. The patient doesn't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at their work about the situation and that is annoying too since people get mad at the patient. The patient feels stuck. They have tried to talk to the co worker Joe, but it didn't seem to work. The patient feels they are not able to find a clear plan and have exhausted all options. The patient does not know whom to complain to at the company since there is no committee and feels HR might not be of help too. The patient thinks of a complaint box with which they could pass on the complaint. They feel even if it is not resolved, it will brought up in a meeting and they will be able to discuss with their boss and a feel a lot less stressed. The patient feels better just thinking of another option. The therapist schedules following session next week. "

grandchildren do you think that intergenerational contact important \\s patient: very important \\s therapist: why \\s patient: because you when you bring up children you havent time to see world through their eyes or even really listen to them because youre too busy preoccupied but then grandchildren come along more importantly now great grandchildren seeing world fresh through these new eyes just its quite mind blowing actually so ive learned lot in old days grandchildren used to learn grandparents knee but nowadays its grandparents learning at grandchildrens knees now definitely oh yes \\s therapist: yes do you think it also benefits them to spend time with people of different different generations different ages \\s patient: well as i said they dont see it use age you see yeah

just always say yes yes good philosophy except drugs try everything try everything once \\s therapist: whats your view on nutrition kind of you know having healthy diet \\s patient: i think i think younger generation stress on it too much far too much when when do you think that if my generation are living to be 100 we were brought up with dripping sandwiches maybe with marbling in blah etc etc full cream milk all rest of it why get stressed out you know just eat everything in moderation enjoy life for goodness sake \\s therapist: yeah i quite like that phiosophy how do you minimize effects

really cross with somebody id really like to speak my mind to them im very good at writing letters i dont send letter to them but i do write it down get it out of my system i keep it in drawer in case one day i might need to plunk it down in front of them but its you know its off its out of my head if i need to go to doctor about anything i will write down what i want to say to him because i dont

enjoy every day as it comes not get hung up about age yeah because im surrounded by 90 year olds now honestly theyre like nine years old we have biggest laughs they do silliest things you know we feel as if weve been set free from actual age you know youre mother set an example to children right oh youre daughter you know \\s therapist: so do you think it makes difference kind of moving on from those responsibilities kind of times of life so when you when you are looking after your children that what you mean by you feel sense of relief later \\s patient: yes because youre not no ones judging you except that youre hanging around too long but apart from that yeah no its its good i mean i was brought up by victorian father who was bank manager it was always just remember who i am in this town you know they were somebody in those days youre my children then i went to convent grammar just remember who you are girls your convent grammar school girl you know so it didnt leave much to send it it didnt leave much pressure to yeah yeah so yeah theres all these pressures as youre going through life so its nice to be my husband died in his 50s so i had to reinvent myself which was

all physical tests brain scans everything scanned \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: it was it was better than 1000 mile service i thought well im doing this for right reasons i know that but who knows they might find something totally wrong with me thats way i found out so its win win situation i believe yeah you know that if they do accept you i was oldest one that theyve ever had this itll last 20 years apparently kidney can last 20 years that yeah that was good yeah so so win win \\s therapist: i i think ive asked most most things on my list that i wanted to talk about there anything that you think that ive missed that worth covering in terms of theme of living well for longer \\s patient: well i think if you can do something for somebody else for whatever reason however tiny comeback to yourself just huge but as long as you dont look for that comeback but it just it just yeah it also consolidates reason why youre still alive that you know that youre not just taking up space on

its something really different for you \\s patient: umm hmm i have ive not done this before \\s therapist: well why dont you tell me little bit about what brings you here today \\s patient: im not even sure i am i heard about this place that you work with women who are having trouble with relationship are confused so i thought id give you guys call so im thank you so much for taking time to see me \\s therapist: so youre youve heard little bit about program here would it help if i just explained little bit about what what my role might be today \\s patient: yeah yeah cuz i dont know what to do \\s therapist: what i want to reassure you of that im not here to try tell you anything that you might need to do or to try give you advice or information at all im here to help you in whatever way useful to you to sort out what whats going on what if anything youd like to do differently so this really up to you what you would like to explore today how does that sound \\s patient: that sounds really hard because im not sure im very good at sorting things out myself yeah yeah \\s therapist: so right now youre feeling little overwhelmed with everything thats going on youre not even sure where to start \\s patient: yeah thats good way to put it im kind of confused about what to do next i have little baby at home so i dont i cant think anyway most time \\s therapist: yeah so now anything any kind of decisions you make or anything that you do affects both you baby \\s patient: mm hmm my boyfriend affects him which why i guess i guess im here to talk about him me baby what were you know how we work together \\s therapist: well i if youre interested or youre willing why dont you tell me little bit about your story \\s patient: i dont know where to start he i had been together for about year i got pregnant right away we just had this baby little while ago before that i was working he i you know were on off here there we get invites he disappears for while then he comes back thats kind of what ears look like i just been getting more more confused on what to do recently he did something really that didnt even look like him he looked like different person it freaked me out freaked baby out quite honestly it freaked him out too he didnt he said he didnt know what happened he felt he said he felt out of control \\s therapist: so in history of relationship over this year its kind of been in out in way there have been some incidents where youve had some arguments then separated for while gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out all all of you baby you him was kind of scary \\s patient: mm hmm yeah he came home i was friend come over man friend he doesnt like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume because im starting to think about going back to work he had weird look in his eye so i kind of you know we sped up i kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark scary look he pushed me onto ground it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together he just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something he said he didnt he would never do that again hes hes really good daddy he really helps us out lot \\s therapist: so in way it doesnt it didnt even really make sense to you or to him because on one hand hes really good good with you good with father i mean good with your child on other hand it was just like what this something really different \\s patient: yeah yeah hes hes he really helps us out i didnt know what to do with that so thats why its i guess that feeling that i have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do \\s therapist: what are your thoughts right now about some of options out there for you to do if if anything what are what are you thinking about \\s patient: i havent talked anybody for for year really \\s therapist: gotten pretty isolated \\s patient: yeah yeah i havent my parents live pretty far away i guess hes kind of boyfriend kind ofi guess words jealous he just really cares about us so i havent had chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will what could i do i used to work i was kind of looking forward to working again hes hes sort of made it clear that i dont need to work because hes going to take care of us he brings home diapers gives us some money when hes around so we really dont need it most time \\s therapist: so you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work doing doing some of that on your on your own yet he he doesnt really hes expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you when hes there he does take care of you \\s patient: yeah yeah yeah it does take care of us hes uh hes he makes sure that i have enough money for you know basic needs in house he pays rent you know but when i when hes gone i run out of money it just kind of thats when i think cut it just wish i could take little bit by myself i just not sure how to go about doing that \\s therapist: does that leaves you in real bind when youre youre there you dont have what you need \\s patient: i yeah i dont know who to talk to about that i try to call him sometimes make up you know say sorry for fight that we had sometimes that works sometimes it doesnt \\s therapist: so youve kind of find yourself when youre in that bind trying to find ways of of getting getting what you need \\s patient: yeah yeah so i dont know how to do this i mean i dont know what to do next not very good at it \\s therapist: i just want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you but i just want to let you know that this i really appreciate how hard this to be able to talk about it its its not an easy situation youre definitely not alone i really appreciate your willingness to talk about it \\s patient: thanks its really hard to \\s therapist: yeah i know there are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves things that we can talk about focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: some of those that we work with are like talking about relationship youve mentioned few things about your your relationship how it kind of goes in out its can be really good then he can be gone for while just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that we can certainly talk about resources about resources in community that may be there for you or in terms of your own understanding but also if you if you are in need of additional help we can talk about those we can talk about safety planning i mean one of one of important things to try help you find way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself in your baby safe we can talk about that we can talk about finances you mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now we can certainly for that little bit more taking care of yourself which \\s patient: yeah right \\s therapist: yeah yeah for many many new new moms thats hard under any circumstances to find way to take care of themselves keep themselves healthy so thats certainly something we can talk about also just whole issue about taking care of your child your your mothering your parenting how you might how you might focus on that in this situation or there might be something else that you feel really important to deal with right up front just to start with what do you think \\s patient: well its its funny as youre showing me this i ive been thinking all ive been doing focusing on baby being good mom yet im also trying to think about getting job i dont know how those two fit together even as im just saying that out loud im not even talking about taking care of him which weird that im not even when i look at this these circles i am looking at mothering children finances that seems to be important yet im spent i spend so much time thinking about him all time right now im not \\s therapist: so maybe you spend lot of time already thinking about your relationship really struggling with what what it means where it now youre kind of think well maybe i think about some other things see where i might go with those \\s patient: these things if job taking learning how to be better mother might be might help relationship so that might be \\s therapist: so might be way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get job or look at possibility of doing that same time trying to incorporate youre taking care of your child that those things might help you um free you up to figure out then what to do about relationship \\s patient: what to do about relationship yeah what to do about relationship im not sure what to do with relationship \\s therapist: yeah you know youre only one that that really will know about that about dealing with relationship about what when timing right for any decision that you make one way or other \\s patient: i dont even know what to think about that i dont know how to yeah i dont feel like ive been making any decisions \\s therapist: yeah well it sounds like youd like to think about making some decisions in other areas when you think about that that right would you like to focus little bit on just possibility of getting job if thats something youd like to talk about \\s patient: yeah how to balance that with being mom at same time because that sounds really hard \\s therapist: well you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after baby was born what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that in thinking about thinking about that what have you thought about \\s patient: well i guess i think initially that i would need his help more he would need to help take care of baby he doesnt do that now so i dont know it be kind of scary that i dont know what that would look like so i would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even just part time so i could get some childcare or something yeah \\s therapist: so you might have to explore some other options for child care in other ways of taking care of baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work \\s patient: yeah yeah somebody i trusted yeah id have to figure out just timing of that job that would fit schedule where i could still breastfeed help her with her naps make sure im there for bedtime all those important times but make enough money that it was worthwhile to to do it yeah to be out working paying somebody that sounds like lot \\s therapist: it really does sound though like you youre really deeply committed to taking care of your child providing kind of structure things basic needs really taking care of your child at same time \\s patient: umm mm hmm its very important to me i didnt i didnt think i was i wanted to have children then we did so i would like him to be daddy in that wow just well as i was thinking about him not being around as daddy im not really sure what to do with that but baby baby most important thing right now \\s therapist: right \\s patient: i didnt realize that ive spent so much time thinking about him all time when we can hear back does he love us why heck did he do that that weird thing why does he care about these other things that he cares about \\s therapist: like being jealous not wanting you to have friends \\s patient: yeah why does he it has nothing to do with what im thinking about now which baby \\s therapist: but its weve mentioned that couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you way youre thinking about it in way youre approaching it like youre recognizing were seeing that youve spent lot of time really agonizing over over relationship why things are happening in relationship or what it really means youve spent lot of time there that kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently \\s patient: agonizing i guess thats what ive been doing i feel like ive just been hoping wishing it seems like all my focus always so when babys crying im worrying about him so baby crying just its hard but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that i could actually think about why babys crying as opposed to why why he not returning my calls or why did he give me that look when i you know talked about getting job things like that its not so interesting \\s therapist: so youre realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on baby to be able to do it its like i its hard to do both its hard to really think about doing both \\s patient: i need his help with that yeah i dont need to be worrying about him too \\s therapist: hmm \\s patient: i dont understand what safety planning means \\s therapist: well one of things that we we look at trying to help people who are in situation similar to you where where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen or you know i know you said he had indicated that he wouldnt do it again but sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up how to get you your baby safe if thats what needs to happen \\s patient: so if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again which actually ive seen before but he just never really did anything like this before \\s therapist: he just went farther this time \\s patient: yeah okay so like if i recognize if i saw that look what to do \\s therapist: yeah yeah sometimes that ties in with you know there might be places that you can go to get saved there might be steps that you can take to to really keep yourself safe or make sure that babys safe for people to call or think just things that you can do based on what your life like what you what resources you have available to you that something youre interested in really exploring \\s patient: sounds kind of freaky to think that i would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me you know love baby sounds little strange \\s therapist: some ways it just seems like it shouldnt have to be that way \\s patient: no shouldnt have to be that way but i didnt expect him to do what he did either so that kind of came out of nowhere \\s therapist: really took you by surprise its something that youre just trying to figure out where how does this fit what it what does it mean what do i do with it what what how do i how do i respond to this \\s patient: yeah it doesnt seem real so i guess thinking about thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time \\s therapist: yeah well let me see if i if i got it all then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take next step with that i want to make sure i understand little bit about your situation \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: this first of all this first time youve come in this first time that youve had something that really happened this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some steps because it scared you you you are wanting to protect yourself your baby you really want to protect baby you have this relationship thats been cut off on but hes been very supportive helpful in terms of giving you meeting your basic needs babys basic needs wants to take care of you there are times when its really good there are times when youve been less sure this this incident has also made you to kind of think about that some of ways that youve been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprises you but youre looking at thinking about possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work little bit so that you can have more financial independence if you will or be able to take care of yourself at for those times when you need to youre starting to toy with idea of maybe it might be useful to have really good plan to keep yourself safe did i kind of get it all \\s patient: that yeah that kind of captures it all yes yeah i dont know i dont know where to start but i guess thats why im talking to you \\s therapist: yeahyeah so maybe we can we can take that next step in when when when we get together again we can do that we can just take next step start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those areas for keeping yourself safe for you know looking at possibilities because there are options resources out there should you choose to make decision to go back to work there are some options for you \\s patient: so theres like good somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that \\s therapist: there are other options for for variety of things we can make some have some discussions about that \\s patient: okay okay does that sound that sounds good okay nice \\s therapist: well i really appreciate again youre coming in today we will follow up with this conversation in it you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decisions that you need again they are your decisions about what if anything you want to change what your next step \\s patient: thank you i think ill go get my baby from childcare well should we make another appointment or something \\s therapist: yes lets make another appointment \\s patient: okay thank you",

all too much for us \\s therapist: i can see that i can see youre getting quite stressed about it so have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this kathleen there anything you think you could do \\s patient: well apart from just i dont i dont believe its such good job but ill probably have to ill have to ill have to tell some ill have to tell her i think im gonna have

easy she lovely i just thought i dont i dont want to annoy her \\s therapist: okay because she was lovely there she says do you think that if you were able to go talk to her that shed actually be quite receptive to listening to you \\s patient: well of course she wouldnt she \\s therapist: okay what im going to suggest kathleen that we do something called role play what that that we act out situation whatever it in your case its going to be you going talking to your boss trying to explain to her that youve got problem trying to fit your work into house which supposed to be working so youll be playing you end up playing your boss now obviously youre not going to get exactly same responses from your boss that youll get from me today but it does give you chance to think about way you might approach it to practice it to get response that you can then react to practice your way through possible scenario what this could do happily give you bit more confidence about swing \\s patient: what do you put in \\s therapist: well we practice it right now oh i can what well do youll be you ill be doctor that youre going to see lets just think about couple of things to get it started \\s patient: so i pretend that im going to be coming into her tutorial okay \\s therapist: well what do you think would be best time of day to do it oh topic day \\s patient: time of day im so busy so busy during day im probably early morning might be best first first thing in morning \\s therapist: sounds like good idea because then you dont have to worry \\s patient: thats true \\s therapist: okay so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say how are you going to introduce \\s patient: i suppose i could say to her this good time to talk \\s therapist: thats fantastic \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: because that gives her chance opportunity to say well no it isnt could you come in five minutes im sorry oh go straight into it thats really good okay should we give it try \\s patient: okay all right \\s therapist: so im gonna get you to stand up pretend that you knocking on doors that what you do yes yes all right so i want you to get out just do that then come back in as if youre having to see your boss boss to tell me what to \\s patient: do role plays out \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: okay now good time to talk \\s therapist: yeah sure good thank you \\s patient: well problem marianne on on having im having problems coping with my workload at moment mainly because its putting me here too late in afternoon remember when you first put me on miles were 830 to 330 as well no im finishing later later 430 sometimes 5 ive got too much work lot to finish on time because i have to pick them up from school you know what they like so im just wondering if if we can work well \\s therapist: obviously youre employed 830 to 330 kathlleine hours we want you to work so we dont want you working back so first of all this important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 thats what i want you to do but from what youre saying work youre being given doesnt fit into those hours \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: whats happening here im getting too much work from other doctors \\s patient: all right i dont know i dont think youre not but i didnt think that id be getting work of four because this doctors here only doing your work \\s therapist: i think ive got picture \\s patient: i dont i dont like saying no to them though \\s therapist: im glad you came to me i really need this job look im really glad you came to see but obviously 830 to 330 not enough its long day early as youre supposed to work so i need to have look into this see whats going on \\s patient: its only half my day other half starts when i pick my boys up they say naughty they are they are really well certainly \\s therapist: kathleen yes ill have look at it but i want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day \\s patient: well i think because ive done that little rolle play feel little bit better probably gone seen doctor will help \\s therapist: obviously responses that i gave are not going to be ones youll get from doctor because she sure this what she said she so therell be something similar but important thing i think to work out that first opening gambit isnt it its true to do that then flow on so thats something i want you to think about perhaps few you guys come see me next week about week perhaps \\s patient: i have to sit home \\s therapist: well lets look at it what id like you to do think about what weve done today yes but but dont dont dont overdo it dont sort of keep it down for your mind well exactly thats what i was going to say i can see that youre getting bit too \\s patient: i dont like confrontation i dont like telling people what to do \\s therapist: i know yeah so having right words help that will help you to get bit of confidence there but importantly i think we need to relax bit dont we there are some very simple relaxation exercises that i can teach you that id like you to go away practice so that horrified by next week when you come youll practice those relaxation exercises because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation ill tell you what i know you dont have to lie on floor not for these because thats not very practical before you go see your boss so what i suggest we look at you coming back in weeks time your practice relaxation exercises well go through them again we perhaps do another role play then maybe we might be ready to go do it for real what do you think \\s patient: okay thats that sounds good i feel little bit more relaxed just thinking about that actually",

            "therapist: so i understand that youve come in because youre having little difficulty in your relationship about that \\s patient: so basically its been getting little bit worse since we got married we got married about year half ago you know woman that i married i thought we were both kind of independent people i thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing like we used to college but its kind of gotten to point now where its like i just want my own personal space i i dont want to be left alone sometimes \\s therapist: alright so youre looking for independence in your relationship now how long have you been together about year \\s patient: total four or five years married for year half \\s therapist: when franklin did you notice that what you kind of think it was problem like independence lack of independence \\s patient: i guess kind of once we got married after that it seemed like you know we were spending all of our time together which you know at first was great because were newlyweds you know we love spending time together everything but i guess probably about you know six months to year after we first got married its kind of you know progressed to point where you know now its just kind of becoming like burden that whatever i do shes always there with me were always spending every waking moment together sometimes its just nice to have my own personal space freedom you know \\s therapist: so youre looking for that freedom sarah this kind of resonate with you \\s therapist: can you can you tell him that \\s therapist: so frank whats it like to hear that \\s patient: it kind of reminds me of how it used to be you know like she said weve been dating for four or five years you know back then it it wasnt problem you know she could go out do her own thing i could go out do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that were spending every moment together you know its just im always worried about her shes always worried about me you know when when i do get chance to go you know hang out with some friends or something like that it always feels like you know ive pressure on me because i should be with her she shouldnt be there with me you know i feel like im doing wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself i feel guilty i do \\s therapist: so sarah do you sense that frankly feels guilty about that \\s therapist: you feel rejected \\s patient: this little bit after so like i said probably first six months to year it was it was really good but then you know reselling kind of burden you know just always spending time together trying to make amends try not to get into fights because were always spending so much time together \\s therapist: so you mentioned that six months to year has been same for you like was beginning of marriage something different to what you have that \\s therapist: so for you couple months after that initial phase so around same time you started experiencing this difficulty in marriage \\s therapist: okay are you okay with some space \\s patient: you dont seem real certain \\s therapist: so maybe this this idea of space isnt really something you feel will work for you \\s therapist: do want to try to address franks concerns about space \\s therapist: you seem apprehensive about it \\s therapist: so maybe just experiment with it try it for one night see what happens so in year half youve been married there ever been night when youve gone out by yourself \\s patient: yeah its been couple especially earlier on which nice you know just you know getting to see old friends you know our old college friends like of course we attended you know events together like seeing old friends everything like that but theres been theres been few times you know not not more than i can count on both my hands but theres been few times where ive you know gone out just had like you know guys night or something \\s therapist: okay what would happened like in terms of like between you so \\s patient: just getting out of house basically hardest part you know just finding way to ensure that you know itll be okay im going to be back home later on in night that she doesnt need to worry about me you know if i have any trouble or anything pops up that i need her help ill let her know you know just knowing that i love her telling her that i love her making sure that she knows that ill be back but you know sometimes its hard because she just gets upset when i tell her that im leaving she doesnt want me to go she would rather me stay or even take her with me you know i dont want to be only guy that shows up with my wife you know everybody else left their wives at home also so i dont want to be odd man out \\s therapist: all right so this really an experiment thats already been tried \\s patient: tried twice yeah \\s therapist: yeah just just few times there any reason to believe that if you try it next week itll be different \\s patient: thats not good \\s therapist: dont you dont think so \\s patient: well yeah mean weve been doing it you know past couple months but it seems like every time we do you know same result its her getting worried about me you know me trying to find way to assure her that its gonna be okay you know that were so married were still in love you know everything like that but you know its just i really want my space it seems like sometimes i just cant get out of her crib \\s therapist: sir what do you think about that \\s therapist: all right so in terms of going out although going out with your friends wouldnt have to be on weekend that something could happen during week \\s patient: yeah absolutely you know lot of my friends normally go out during week because you know they have their families everything to take care of on weekend so yeah i could definitely go out tonight during week \\s therapist: okay so you could agree both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends youll spend those weekends together \\s patient: i think we could try that \\s therapist: because that was concern you specifically brought up how about sarah how about times during week how do you feel about those \\s therapist: you feel like youd respond better to that would that be better experience \\s therapist: something that you think that you could try next week \\s therapist: so lets talk about when because youve gone out before you said it was just getting out getting out house that was real challenge right so walk me through this really goes through both of you what we through what happens when youre when youre getting ready to leave when youre planning to head out \\s patient: so you know usually ill go get dressed ill let her know where im going you know give her my cell phone number you know somebody elses phone number in case my phone off just basically tell her what were going to do you know whether were going out to to pole or you know going to watch some sporting event or something like that no i would tell her what were doing you know just so she knows knows where she can find me but then after that it seems like as soon as i assure her of what were doing when its happening when ill be home everything like that it just seems like all progress i made towards front door kind of gets pulled back little bit because like she doesnt want me to leave you know i can see in her eyes that shes not very happy about me leaving her that kind of makes me feel guilty you know because i dont want to leave her alone i want her to be more independent i kind of want her to you know if im going out i would like her to go out as well you know she says tons of friends you know we both have friends we both have our social circles shes kind of its frustrating when i cant go do my thing because shes always got to be with me \\s therapist: so ultimately after all that you you do go but you feel feel guilty do you have good time \\s patient: most of time right do you know sometimes i just cant get over fact that you know my wife at home whos upset at me that makes me upset you know its just matter of finding balance between you know my independence her you know doing her own thing because i would like her to do that as well \\s therapist: so sometimes you have good time sometimes you dont youre worried about sarah being home how about when you come home \\s patient: when i come home usually things go back to normal i mean weve definitely had our exchange of words after few times me coming back but most of time it goes back to normal which you know its fine were very loving affectionate couple so thats awesome but you know most time its just overbearing \\s therapist: that how you see it sarah way frank described it \\s therapist: so how about one out like so after after hes left what do you what are you thinking that like \\s therapist: youre anxious something bads gonna happen \\s therapist: do you think that theres been any reason for that thinking like do you think theres any basis for thinking something bads gonna happen \\s patient: absolutely not no no i love sarah you know five years that weve worked together been great you know its its just where we are now as opposed to where we first were when we first got married its its changed you know i would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes i guess i dont always relay that well to her she doesnt understand why i want my space i want to go hang out with my friends but ive been trying to explain to her that you know its its two way street its not just all one way so we have to work on these issues you know thats why we came to you \\s therapist: alright so youre really frustrated by not being able to go out go out but youre anxious about when he goes out so we talked about possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to same difficulties you experienced before what can we change to increase chances of that experiment working \\s therapist: so so if you called when he was at piedmont answer thats something thats normally possible \\s patient: yeah yeah most of time im very good at responding to you know making sure that she knows im okay making sure that shes okay \\s therapist: so thats compromise youd be willing to make absolutely something like that \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you need any other reassurances from frank sarah \\s therapist: do you have plan to call frank like when hes out or it something that you would do if you just felt need to or \\s therapist: were you calling for some specific reason \\s therapist: why dont you start reinsurance everythings going right okay so that seems reasonable to you right i mean i i guess \\s patient: but at same time like when im out doing my own thing you know i kind of want that privacy in that you know just being in moment you know because i know when i get back home from back with you im nothings changed because ive always been with you like were still married but when im out with my friends you know im getting couple phone calls during you know night over course of night its having to deal with my wife having to make sure that she knows im okay everything like that it it gets little frustrating its little i mean frustrating \\s therapist: would that be good compromise it was text or two i guess thats better than phone call right yeah so not ideal but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety bit right maybe work toward little bit more freedom so thats how i can experiment you both combined to try \\s patient: okay so we could try try it out \\s therapist: alright so its not perfect plan but its one that you know i would hope that we could be successful with if you could though youre going through it maybe track what happens right from your own perspective like what you were thinking fact left what you were thinking when you left how it went how that separation kind of was conducted what happened same thing when while youre out how many times you texted her if you called then what happened when he got back right thats just kind of you can you can keep record of those things just independently you know you write it down come your experience you write down your experience well come back next time no matter what happens with it well compare kind of see what see what happened how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better",
            "The patients got a married one and a half years ago. They have been having trouble with their personal space, being independent and the lack of it, both. Frank has issues to do things independently as he feels pressure to be with her. It makes him feel guilty. Sarah feels rejected. The patients have experimenting hanging out separately twice and it hasn't worked out well. Frank expresses that he feels the need to assure Sarah when he is out, and Sarah feels anxious for the time when Frank is out. Sarah agrees a couple texts and a phone call when Frank is out will help. The therapist asks to note down these experiences before the next meeting of how they both feel, and it can be discussed in the next session. "

therapist: okay so what happened from there then just tell me little bit about whats happened so that im up to speed \\s patient: i went for that scan then i was bit surprised actually they actually rang me up few days afterwards said that i needed another scan to check things out okay so i was there it was on monday this week dont let anything then \\s therapist: okay so in between scan happening second scan happening was it department \\s patient: no no it was it was nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this disappointments for this extra scan \\s therapist: did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra \\s patient: no they didnt actually i mean i try to ask you always do play sweet talk lady but she was not pretending \\s therapist: okay i do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back \\s patient: i guess it was gallstones \\s therapist: so just tell me little bit about what symptoms youve been having them but we do have scan result here today theres some scuffs on it \\s patient: right \\s therapist: i just like to make sure that i know whats been happening to you first of all then well go into detail \\s patient: all started few months ago ray with his tummy pain \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: then i saw your colleague he said we better get scan yeah i went for that scan it was only about two weeks ago i got literally four or five days later got phone call i needed this additional scan so i went on monday \\s therapist: okay okay so do you still have pain at abdomen \\s patient: yes yeah its just there all time \\s therapist: okay well as i said you scan result has come through to me today \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: im afraid im afraid there something thats potentially little bit worrying on it \\s patient: really \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: so whats whats worrying thing that you found \\s therapist: well if i take you back to first scan first so what it appears that that showed that there was something suspicious on what we call pancreas gland \\s patient: suspicious \\s therapist: yeah so there gland that sort of top of your abdomen which quite closely evolved right called pancreas when they did ultrasound scan which good scan but isnt particularly detailed right there was something on it that they saw that they wanted bit more info \\s patient: all right \\s therapist: so thats why they called you back for second scan \\s patient: that doesnt sound good does they \\s therapist: which was ct scan which detail that were likely to be talking about \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so second scan i showed that there definitely something on your pancreas \\s patient: really \\s therapist: when i say something what we worry about whether or not this could be cancer \\s patient: god i didnt expect that god i am only 47 cancer \\s therapist: im really sorry to have to break it to you like this but i felt that it was important that as soon as i knew that i communicated that to you so i mean i know that ive just dropped big bombshell on you \\s patient: oh yes god \\s therapist: have you got any any questions in minute have you got anything that you can query \\s patient: whats pancreas i have got cancer what can i can make can they cut it out \\s therapist: it depends basically pancreas brand that sort of sits at top of abdomen as i said it controls some of sort of hormones fluids that your body prefers body because its at back of abdomen often we dont know very much about it until it starts causing bit of problem like your pain that youve been getting so that probably explains why youve not had many other symptoms \\s patient: right \\s therapist: answer i dont know what could be done about it but we need to ask specialist what we usually do this situation asked especially today to see what has happened think about what was cooking right do they agree that it could be potentially cancer how do we find out what it definitely \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: so i understand that ive just thrown whole lot of information at you \\s patient: i just hasnt expected that so \\s therapist: i mean there there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them oh quit i went on bit of chat maybe tomorrow when youve had bit bit more time \\s patient: i suppose i could love myself no doubt come by myself actually yeah okay it will just be easier feel sure \\s therapist: i mean i think its important to say that we dont know for definite what this we have to imagine that it something like cancer until we can prove what right so we do everything very quickly yeah try get some answers right but we dont know any definite nothing certain in minute but i do appreciate that ive just given you little bit of time so my door open yes okay have you got any questions \\s patient: no \\s therapist: ive taken liberty of printing off little bit of something about pancreatic cancer if thats what it \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: some of its little bit little bit scary as i said we dont know nothing certain yet i wonder if you might want to come back to see me so what this does it just explains little bit about what pancreas right \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: it talks about cancer in general types of ways in which you can affect pancreas \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: how we do it how we work out what we do about it talks about different types of scans that youve had this one cts \\s patient: yes okay \\s therapist: then depending on what they find yeah it gives you brief run through of different types of treatment \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: did you want to have read through this then maybe tomorrow \\s patient: yeah we like tomorrow yeah okay i like this \\s therapist: ill see you tomorrow",

            "therapist: hi joe how are doing today \\s patient: im doing okay \\s therapist: just okay \\s patient: well i know weve talked before about me thinking about suicide im starting to think about it you know like little bit stronger than before i think little bit more clearly \\s therapist: so can you can tell me little bit more about that \\s patient: um well one weve talked before ive had feelings thoughts of suicide but now its kind of starting to like im thinking about it more often im thinking about little more clearly thats alarming to me \\s therapist: do you want to die \\s patient: yeah i will yeah sometimes \\s therapist: sometimes \\s patient: um i mean you know sometimes i know it would be scary to try it my husband would be so hurt but at same time i want to end this i want to end feeling that im having depression yeah \\s therapist: okay do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decide to do that \\s patient: i mean i know if i wanted to that we have pills in cabinet so it wouldnt be that hard i could just take bottle \\s therapist: just same pills that you prescribed for depression \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: do you feel like youre going to carry out that plan \\s patient: no i mean part of it thats why im nervous because like im worried that i might but at same time you know im afraid to so sometimes i think that i might sometimes i think i wont i dont want to but sometimes i get scared that i will \\s therapist: today youre little worried that you will or youre little closer to it then than usual weve talked about this before in past youve come in youve had kind of that same plan to pills thoughts what what stops you those times was stuck in past \\s patient: in past i thought this will get better i just have to keep trying i thought what will my husband feel when im gone my family my parents my brother sister i thought that this as bad as it can get it has to get better eventually but now im just starting to feel like i dont think its gonna get better \\s therapist: alright so theres times before when you had same feeling right you felt just as bad as you feel now really down hopeless what happened few days after that after thoughts suicide went away what was your outlook on life that \\s patient: i mean i feel i feel little better you know then id say to myself that was silly you know i dont want to do that i dont i dont want to end things you know its its too rash but you know its starting to feel like permanent problem \\s therapist: so if you feel like this time these suicidal thoughts are markedly different than what youve experienced before \\s patient: i wouldnt say markedly but i would say theyre different theyre little theyre stronger \\s therapist: more intense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: when you think about this these feelings on before we talked about i know this relationship surrounding relationships same thing this time \\s patient: i mean i guess that has something to do with it i guess its just like when i look to everything like everything that could be good or everything just everything like life my relationships future i just look at it i see despair i just see everything going wrong i just dont see how it could get better i just dont see it \\s therapist: in sense of hopelessness \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so this time different because you feel its very less situational less tired of relationships more well philosophical youre looking at your outlook youre saying its not gonna get any better whats point going on so this little bit new territory for you how long weve been feeling this way with intensity right now \\s patient: probably week maybe little less \\s therapist: what was prevented you from hurting yourself those last week \\s patient: im afraid to do it im just scared its like its like jumping off diving board like you get up to edge you stand there thats where that \\s therapist: have you made any gestures to harm yourself like if you went grabbed pills or went to medicine cabinet looks at pills anything like that \\s patient: sometimes i look at them look at them \\s therapist: dont think further than look at them \\s patient: well i mean so i have to take them its my prescription so when its time i start thinking about it like its more i think about my like ideations come even more because its like trigger like im thinking about pills so i go to cabinet i get my pills i i take one that im supposed to but i just look at bottle i kind of stand there i just think instead of putting bottle back i could take it with me \\s therapist: what do you end up doing \\s patient: it takes while but i put it back its its scary like i look into bottle im afraid because dying scary but \\s therapist: how about pain that you would cause husband rest of your family \\s patient: yeah i dont want to do that \\s therapist: you dont want that \\s patient: i dont i dont i dont want my husband to find me i dont want him to feel like this his fault i dont want him to be sad that im gone i dont want him to feel like i feel \\s therapist: when relatives of somebody that committed suicide hear about suicide who do they blame \\s patient: yeah its not its not their fault i know that they wouldnt be able to get over it i know that theyll be thinking about how bad i felt theyll have to know what it really felt like for me \\s therapist: so i know this tough time right but good news youre here talking to me about it right now youre talking about it im gonna guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better are you gonna carry out your plan or youre gonna hurt yourself \\s patient: i dont want to \\s therapist: are you going to \\s patient: no i think i think if i can just remember what itll be like for them thatll keep me from doing it you know its times that i forget to think about how theyre going to feel that i get closer to edge but when i remember you know like it upsets me to think about what itll be like for them so if i can remember to think about that itll help me not do that but i think having pills there in cabinet like that big temptation for me \\s therapist: okay so can we can we do this your husbands at home right you mentioned you take two pills once day \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: before for bed \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: can we would you be willing to sign release so i can talk to him he can hold on to those pills just give you pill each night take one i will that be okay \\s patient: yeah i think i think that would be good idea \\s therapist: there anything else in medicine cabinet or anywhere else in house to give you danger to \\s patient: i think i think yeah i think it would be good idea to just make sure that everything that was in medicine cabinet \\s therapist: all tools \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: would he be willing to do that \\s patient: right yeah i think yeah i think that he would be willing to do that he doesnt he wants me to get through this \\s therapist: okay if i get release for talk you might sign it \\s patient: yeah oh ill do that \\s therapist: okay are you familiar before are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety or prior time so youve been state similar to this can you promise me that youre going to not hurting yourself \\s patient: i can yeah i can do that at least until next week when we meet again i promise \\s therapist: lets be little certain that okay sets up that for more \\s patient: okay yeah we can definitely do that i can do that \\s therapist: i know this rough time trying to appreciate how rough it for you i want you to keep in mind how you felt after times before now you do tend to pull out of this you look back at lot differently but in moment its hard to see that that doesnt necessarily make this any easier but if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression youll probably have different outlook if history any evidence does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so what do you have planned for us today \\s patient: um you know im just gonna go home my husband will be home work have dinner watch tv \\s therapist: so are you gonna be alone anytime between when you leave here when you come see me anymore \\s patient: um yeah ill probably be home for little while in morning but i have to work so i wont have you know ill be busy \\s therapist: okay if these feelings intensified or you do feel youre gonna act on them which promised to call me kill me call 911 \\s patient: yeah ill do that okay \\s therapist: im gonna get that release so you can talk to your husband then see it for few minutes or so point for more all right \\s patient: thank you \\s therapist: thanks joe",

normal things \\s therapist: that was gonna be really well im going to ask next i mean what are your thoughts about how he could help you today \\s patient: well i just thought with sleeping tablets i thought they might help \\s therapist: would it be good idea perhaps if we think about all options available to you then decide which which ones may be best for you \\s patient: okay are there any other options \\s therapist: we might have heard of some of talking therapies being able to sit down talk with us sort of trained counselor about about your feelings about whats been happening \\s patient: well that will hekp my sleep well let me be able to cope next day to sleep \\s therapist: it may help you deal with some of your feelings i take on board about thoughts about using sleeping tablet i think that could be another option obviously when concerns we have that we dont want to have you on sleeping tablets for long period of time because their issues about becoming dependent on them reliant on them we can use them for short period of time say for week to help you get back into bit more of normal sleep \\s patient: yeah that sounds good to me \\s therapist: whats about those two options as option counselor or perhaps sleeping pills \\s patient: counseling chair counseling id like i mean i just feel if i had some sleeping tablets i might just just give me spare really im quite happy with counseling as well \\s therapist: okay so youd like to try both i think that that sounds good idea would you be happy to counselor here at surgery \\s patient: yes thatd fine \\s therapist: okay so i can organize that i can speak to her ask her to contact you to make an appointment it also be really helpful for me as well if you could complete one of our heads questionnaires \\s patient: most question perhaps question \\s therapist: sorry its short questionnaire just asking some questions about your feelings itll help me to find out if theres any more help i can give you an annex see if thats okay from what youve told me today i mean it sounds really for last 12 months or so youve felt really low since split from you your husband \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: your sleeps not being good your appetite not being good \\s patient: i am mess \\s therapist: sounds to me self esteems taking real not because i certainly think help we can give you with some counts in which we have counselor that comes here in surgery that will be itll be benefit to you then well try short course of sleep tablets to try get you back into state sleep pattern \\s patient: okay \\s

\\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so anxiety really high what happened yesterday anxiety really high can be quick summary \\s patient: anxiety always really high but yesterday was worst \\s therapist: why \\s patient: we were driving my dad was driving i was in passenger seat we were in lot of traffic that you know that already makes me nervous i like to be on time \\s therapist: i know \\s patient: i dont want to be late because then what if i get in trouble so its already kind of on edge then we passed accident that i guess was causing off traffic there were two cars they were like mashed together like accordions there was tarp i know that under that tarp there was dead body car went right by it \\s therapist: thats scary \\s patient: this horrible \\s therapist: kind of explains that number hmm \\s patient: yeah who wouldnt be anxious thats like normal thing because theres dead body \\s therapist: well id be anxious of course its kind of scary to see that what else did you think when you saw that \\s patient: who would drive when theres two cars mash together like accordions on dead body thats insane you have to be insane to drive \\s therapist: your family wants you to learn to drive this year because youre 16 \\s patient: theyre insane \\s therapist: yet you all you you keep complaining how you live in middle of nowhere if you had car you could like go see friends more get out of your lame old town get to go do fun things \\s patient: i cant see my friends anymore if im dead \\s therapist: true thats true i wont get to see you anymore because youre dead you know i dont treat dead people right remember that yeah okay so on one hand i know idea of driving completely overwhelming i know youre anxious like all time \\s patient: i get that i have to drive because youre right its like middle of nowhere i cant just like not go places but \\s therapist: so im wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things youre talking about to help reduce your anxiety maybe thats one idea to help you be able to get in drivers seat what do you think so essentially youre practicing getting driver seat by like doing this treatment get in drivers seat of your anxiety as opposed to being passenger youre letting anxiety outside really your life because thats what youre doing what do you think \\s patient: theres lot of puns jen \\s therapist: im punning aint i so heres an idea lets get on board we start treating this anxiety we do it really really good job at it we work hard idea driving might not be quite as scary lets face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents \\s patient: well thats helpful thanks \\s therapist: so reducing your anxiety its gonna make you safer driver \\s patient: yeah but all these things you keep telling me that i have to do to be less anxious they involve like feeling really anxious \\s therapist: true \\s patient: theres no way to like cant youre supposed to like just make it go away youre not supposed to make it worse to make it better \\s therapist: so heres whats interesting youre really good at being really anxious so youll be really good at this it will go away i promise you i totally promise you \\s patient: thats soo hard \\s therapist: you know done well im expert here of treating anxiety i promise you it will get better i know everything i know this what do you think \\s patient: i think it sounds really hard its really hard \\s therapist: all i do totally totally hard \\s patient: maybe its just not there same thing that you have to be more anxious to be less anxious \\s therapist: i know it isnt its pretty insane isnt it i agree well another option you could just be anxious rest of your life do they have bus where you live \\s patient: no you know that \\s therapist: live with your parents for rest of your life i know i forgot so you can live with your parents for rest of your life because youre too anxious to leave town you wont be able to drive so you could just live with your parents be anxious all time you could go home so ideas on how to maintain your anxiety rest of your life you wont need to learn to drive i mean your parents are fairly nice they probably drive around for rest of your life you know until they pass away or something in meantime what about that so forget whole treatment im pushing you too hard why dont we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety youre good at it \\s patient: jennas thats not funny \\s therapist: its not meant to be funny what do you think \\s patient: thats horrible \\s therapist: i really want to help you i know being anxious every time really hard so one of options to really become good at being anxious do okay learn to sit with your anxiety another option yeah getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety \\s patient: so youre saying that no matter what i choose its going to involve feeling anxious \\s therapist: yeah for your practice at it \\s patient: well i mean if those are only options might as well do one thats gonna make it eventually go away rather than just be there forever \\s therapist: all right do you want to review what some of treatment strategies will be \\s patient: yeah i guess \\s therapist: okay lets do that",

            "therapist: hi miss clark my name alan lime im social worker at family health center dr steele asked me if i would spend some time with you today im really glad that youre here im just curious as to why he would send you to me \\s patient: well i came to see dr seal last week because of increasing stress anxiety thats kind of getting best of me in course of my appointment with him he was asking how i was dealing with that stress i mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine few nights week turning into more frequent maybe three or four on some nights he had some concerns about that felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something \\s therapist: yeah so he he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress hes concerned that your alcohol consumption may be part of that increase prior to prescribing anything you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that \\s patient: i suppose \\s therapist: okay so you filled in one of pink sheets i take look at that \\s patient: he told me to fill that out bring it with me \\s therapist: okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that little bit as well that you have one or two drinks in one setting \\s patient: typically yeah \\s therapist: maybe monthly you have more than that what whats what kind of drinks do you have what do you do when you typically drink \\s patient: wine with my meals you know again one or two typically more frequently three or four my stress increased \\s therapist: so its time to increase your strength little more well based on what you put here you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone so if its okay with you to talk little bit about that \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: okay so that was sunset run zero to 40 its not sort of super high risk but it certainly could be risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or even stay there this typical standard drink size over here im not sure whether that fits your description of glass of wine or not \\s patient: i feel glass up so maybe little more than that \\s therapist: maybe little space its upset perhaps drink drink half each one so that also increased little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here for women healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting considered to be low or no risk one seven in one week seven total in total week what you say here that even on this sheet youre perhaps already drinking more than that so what do you make of all that \\s patient: that news to me you know i thought red wine with your meals supposed to be healthy you know no more than seven in week that seems kind of prohibitive \\s therapist: yeah it seems seems little less than perhaps youve been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking certainly theres theres conflicting information out there about whats healthy whats not healthy imagine increased stress work because were concerned doctor seal as your stress increases if you were to describe you anything maybe some interaction between two that would also be concern for him i would i would think so if you would what it that you like about alcohol \\s patient: well you know it does at least in moment temporarily reduce my stress i you know like good glass of wine i dont dont drink cheap stuff i like expensive \\s therapist: see like taste of it it does help to lower stress even if its just for fun of me drinking whats not so good things about alcohol for you \\s patient: um well you know nights that maybe i have couple more glasses than i should i wake up feeling kinda yaak of course part of my stress finances i mentioned i like good stuff so if im drinking more than im increasing my financial burden \\s therapist: your financial stress may be increased by fact that youre drinking \\s patient: yeah kind of defeating purpose theyre \\s therapist: drink introduce stress increasing stress at same time so on one hand it low it on other hand its increasing kind of seesaw teeter totter effect what do you make of that given that on one hand it lowers on other hand it increases now its increasing even more \\s patient: maybe i need to find some other way to deal with my stress yeah \\s therapist: imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying \\s patient: well ive exercised in past that helps right now my schedule kind of out of whack i just really dont know what to do thats why i came to see dr seal i thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help you know when im feeling overwhelmed \\s therapist: he may be able to im not saying that he cannot just imagine that hes concerned that if you continue to drink level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with it to mention that hes concerned im not completely sure so youve had some success in past of changing behaviors if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes how important would it be for you on scale of zero to 10 i have low visual hero that if zero not important ten very important to do something about your drinking wine \\s patient: well i mean if if it means that its increasing my stress or hes not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then its fairly important maybe about seven \\s therapist: its its pretty up there what do you choose seven out of five or four \\s patient: well again i got to get things under control you know my kids are dependent on me ive got to go to work to help ease this financial stress so you know all those responsibilities \\s therapist: theres lot riding on your decision on what to do with this what if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale \\s patient: well you know risk that you mentioned about drug interaction i certainly cant afford to you know have any more stress so yeah \\s therapist: so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do \\s patient: hmmm \\s therapist: how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking \\s patient: im pretty confident you know probably about seven or an eight \\s therapist: okay so its pretty high up there again what if what if anything would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit im just curious about that \\s patient: i you know i like lot glass of wine i dont want to quit altogether id be willing to try cutting that but now if its going to if dr seal would agree to prescribe me something for anxiety it meant that i had to not drink at all id be willing to do that at least for period of time \\s therapist: so youd be willing to stop altogether thats what was indicated by physician okay so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether its to cut back whether its to quit \\s patient: well again you know if if i can get something to help me manage if maybe i can find some other way to deal with stress then then you know i be pretty ready again maybe about an on that scale maybe an eight \\s therapist: okay so thats thats pretty hot there as well it sounds as though youre pretty motivated to do something about this right now given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point just on lowering anxiety in general it sounds thats one of your goals as well well im pretty confident once you decide to do whatever it you decide to do youll be able to follow through with it based on your experience in past of making behavior changes i mentioned some things that you can draw upon whats one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress \\s patient: oh i you know that exercise but again thats thats kind of difficult to fit in right now im hoping that dr seal will prescribe something for me to take when im feeling particularly overwhelmed maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of \\s therapist: one of things we can offer here for you to come in talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life this area of increased stress sound like responsibility there we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody \\s patient: that would be nice \\s therapist: that also has some information here if youre interested some pamphlet on alcohol how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well i wish you lots of luck it sounds as though youre really committed to making this shift in this change i imagine doctors still want to follow up with you see how you do with your with your change within few weeks \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: again i look forward to speaking to you in future \\s patient: all right thank you very much",

            "therapist: hi how are you doing today \\s patient: im good but um there has been visual you know we will work out like my motivation sure kind of its kind of related to that um so im in school every few weeks we have like papers to write i know i know what i know i can do it its just actually sitting down doing it \\s therapist: ok will tell me about papers \\s patient: well theyre usually about five pages long i just i just look at it like its five pages but im like okay so i go sit down you know on my computer im like alright im starting references so i get i start off good i do references but then its like i get sidetracked tracked so easily then i end up killing like two hours checking news checking then it goes to my phone then just looking at recipes then it gets really off topic then i realized i havent done anything \\s therapist: alright so you you have five page paper you sit down to work on it you have references you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off little bit \\s patient: oh big time \\s therapist: yeah okay then what happens after you are done wandering little bit \\s patient: i get kind of annoyed with it then im like well you know ive already you know its already 90 time ill try to do it tomorrow then you know either tomorrow doesnt happen or same thing happens its just then i end up rushing right at edge of you know thats due tomorrow getting all these five pages done its really hard for me \\s therapist: so you are youre finishing assignment on time so promise of lateness \\s patient: no i i get it done \\s therapist: you get done \\s patient: its just all at last minute \\s therapist: so its really how time breaks out isnt working out well for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youd rather not be doing it at last moment \\s patient: no i mean i try not to i mean i set time aside to go sit down im like alright you know were gonna start on this paper then sidetracked im watching tv im on my phone im on some other website \\s therapist: so these so these activities that youre engaging in between when you start work before you start writing also regarding references before you start writing you said check an email \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities \\s patient: yeah i mean theres small things that keep my attention but its not where my attention needs to go \\s therapist: these arent particularly engaging activities like something you need to do no at that moment \\s patient: no i mean i look up you know right i started one reference then who this article looks cool who this article you know next thing im know im researching octopuses or something \\s therapist: so like distracted \\s patient: yeah distracted like at work \\s therapist: then theres moment you kind of catch yourself realize you havent really started writing \\s patient: yeah but its like two hours late \\s therapist: too late yeah so youre consuming time there alright so you have few different levels of activity here you have paper which it sounds like youre okay writing but youre youre maybe not highly motivated to write \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: but you seem to be getting references done okay \\s patient: yeah i mean i get some references done okay \\s therapist: you collect material then writing part thats difficult part then you have these behaviors in middle which you enjoy doing little but theyre not something that \\s patient: i mean theyre not something im like am jumping for joy about its just something to to procrastinate so i dont have to do my paper i dont think that i you know im not like oh i need to check my email so i dont have to do my paper its just oh i should check my email oh i should check my phone oh i havent done this one oh i havent seen this in while \\s therapist: but these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay writing of paper \\s patient: yeah thats true \\s therapist: you may not be fully aware of that in moment but then you kind of become aware of that later that thats purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing alright so writing of papers activity thats behavior thats something youre not really looking forward to whats behavior that was an activity that you really do look forward to you know think about some level of engagement there \\s patient: well there this new tv show out that they just started new season i have it all recorded like 24 episodes but i cant find time to watch it but im really you know ive seen first season im so interested in it im cant wait to see next one i guess that that would thats i guess what makes me really happy right now \\s therapist: so so youre excited about this television show you how you have episodes already recorded maybe one of reasons you cant find time because time youre using between two parts of writing this paper \\s patient: yeah i mean this paper taking me lot longer than it should \\s therapist: right so lets lets try this when you when you do write to paper youre really writing it writing part not preparing part but writing part kind of all at end right getting it done this night before its due all right so i want to try couple different behavioral strategies here okay these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation one i think that it might be helpful i want you let me know if im right here to break if its five page paper to break it up into more than one night because right now functionally at least lot of what youre doing on last night okay would be more comfortable pace like like for example how long does it take you to write one page \\s patient: out an hour hour half \\s therapist: so around an hour to an hour half you can complete one page edited proof read \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so it would take about five days to complete whole paper if you did an hour half each day an hour to one i havent checked okay but how much time do you have from when papers assigned to when its due \\s patient: they give us about week half to do \\s therapist: i guess around 10 days yeah \\s patient: um i guess around six oclock like because then im already done eating home from work ive kind of de stressed already six oclock looks like \\s therapist: pretty good time so if you could work without distraction you would be done by around 730 at latest with this one page \\s patient: yeah what one page okay so \\s therapist: no distractions just one page yeah all right so lets talk about episodes tv episodes that you want to watch okay how long are they \\s patient: theyre an hour to an hour okay \\s therapist: once time that you could watch those you get maximum enjoyment out of watching like no distractions i guess \\s patient: i guess around eight oclock because thats when im you know started getting ready for bed starting to like really relax you know my husbands home by that time we can watch it together he loves show too \\s therapist: okay so eight oclock so really good time for you to maximize \\s patient: married thats great \\s therapist: you know thats great motivator for you i want to try to use it as motivator kind of like reward okay so id like you to try to do when you start like when you get all these papers assigned when five five page papers pick five nights that you want to work on it okay it could be monday through friday or whatever works for you \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: all right clearly within 10 day window though all right so five days within 10 day window do you have to turn in then set that time at six oclock when youre going to start because thats good time for you to work \\s patient: so lets keep thinking about that when i feel like im getting off track \\s therapist: yeah thats sure \\s patient: yeah not have to stress right at end \\s therapist: yeah not waste that time in middle yeah right thats thats really eating more time your show takes \\s patient: i see where youre gonna absolutely \\s therapist: does this make sense to you understand kind of \\s patient: yeah you know that helped me power through not do things unrelated by you think well if i get this paper done this page doesnt need to watch my show later \\s therapist: i think thats thats helpful way to think about it thats thats cognitive part of this so this kind of this behavioral strategy because weve talked about these in past right this behavioral strategy cognitive pieces when you find yourself wandering i think you have to detect that you i think you have some level awareness thats happening yeah you have to detect that say i want to watch my show were looking forward to it \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: thats your motivation to move through paper then you know when eight oclock comes okay \\s patient: all right that sounds like plan all right \\s therapist: very good so lets try that for ill see again in roughly two weeks \\s patient: yep all right thank you so few weeks \\s therapist: all right thank you thanks",
            "The patient wishes to work out motivation to write papers. The paper is five pages long and they start with references. Once they complete the references, they get sidetracked easily. The patient ends up killing two hours of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute. The therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write. The therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five days and pick the evenings at six o' clock in the 10 day window when they wish to do. The patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite TV show in the night which will be a great motivator. The therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two weeks."

charged with \\s patient: they didnt explain anything government never explains anything they just dont want me to understand whats going on because they just want to keep me out of captivity \\s therapist: government do you have anyone specific \\s patient: nope its entire government entire government higher government \\s therapist: how long have they been wanting to do this to you \\s patient: all my life ive done this all my life they theyre always listening theyre always around theyre always there \\s therapist: always there \\s patient: always there like for example theyre in lights right now theyre listening to everything that were talking about so thats reason why i really cant talk about what happened on bus because theyre just going to use that against then its locked me up again i think we take more minutes \\s therapist: even taking medications \\s patient: yes i take medication because if i dont take medication government comes takes me away puts me into hospital where they force me medication then lights are always on they can always hear everything that im saying what im thinking what im going to do \\s therapist: do you know what they want to do with that information \\s patient: wanting us to take over world to take over world people in world of course they want to use everything use everything that everybody knows to use it against them so that they can actually have world they want in that baby make everybody pretend that they dont know whats going on so therefore theyre using everybodys thoughts against themselves so that government can use it to their benefit \\s therapist: so what can you do in situation well you said governments monitoring everything they want to put you in jail if you dont take your medication do have any options are you stuck \\s patient: no so when im home i think im perfectly fine because i set up my house in my room to actually make it government proof so that nobody can actually hear see whats going on in there so when im home im perfectly fine \\s therapist: so one option that being home being home youre safe \\s patient: being home being home ive saved my mom saved my brothers save everybody safe being out in world in world thats nobody safe \\s therapist: are you safe here \\s patient: no i told you they are employed they can hear everything that were saying right now so no were not safe here \\s therapist: its just not safe here its not safe out in world at home youre safe \\s patient: at home safe in my room that i mean government \\s therapist: so if you could have your way you would you would stay home most of time all time \\s patient: i would stay home all time but i cant stay home because i mean to go see doctors talk to people do things that government needs me or wants me to do but i dont want to do those things because shes in my thoughts theyre trying to use everybody get sleep i cant deal with that \\s therapist: so how how do you know that theyre in lights like how did you discover that \\s patient: everybody knows that theyre in light its common knowledge its common knowledge everybody knows that \\s therapist: do you ever hear things that other people cant hear or see things that people cant see \\s patient: no of course everybody hears lights talking to you i dont know what youre talking about like everybody hears it sometimes its whisper for some people sometimes its yell if you want to not pay attention to what lights are saying to you then i dont know whats wrong with you but everybody can hear it \\s therapist: whats sound like to you \\s patient: it sounds like robot talking it sounds like we need to know this information we need to what do you do \\s therapist: im just making some notes speaking some weird progress notes does that worry you \\s patient: yes where your notes gonna go \\s therapist: well this chart will get locked in chart room down hall \\s patient: who has access to chart room \\s therapist: mostly everybody works here \\s patient: can i get copy of your notes after youre done \\s therapist: does it worry that theres notes \\s patient: yes because i might trust you i dont know if i do yet but i dont trust other people who work here because i dont know if theyre working for government which they probably are working for government so they can actually have access to all of my notes things that youre writing down which i dont know what they are because youre not going to give me copy of it yet i just dont trust that they can actually get that information because theyre going to use it to their advantage theyre going to give it to government which i cant have that so could you please not take notes \\s therapist: i could not take notes what kind of information notes are you worried that governments gonna get \\s patient: well because i made my room at home government proof i think theyre going to try to steal that technology when i actually create it so that they can then disrupt my room then everybody elses rooms who are just like mine so that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do things that they want me to do \\s therapist: so without protection that your house offers they could control your mind \\s patient: correct without my room without technology systems things that i created then government will be able to control everything that i do \\s therapist: all right so can you tell me about your mood through all this this sounds really stressful youre describing environment where governments frequently looking at what youre doing for feelings are you feel sad or angry \\s patient: i feel fine \\s therapist: you feel fine \\s patient: i dont really have any problem yeah i just i feel fine i dont feel happy i dont feel sad i just im just here \\s therapist: kind of resigned governments gonna do this \\s patient: well governments gonna do what theyre gonna do anyway so it doesnt matter if im happy sad pissed off angry any of that governments going to make me do what they want me to do anyway so it doesnt matter how i feel \\s therapist: are you worried that something going to happen similar will happen on bus \\s patient: no because ive learned my lesson to not say those things out loud into to talk about what governments doing because i cant actually inform anybody else because nobodys listening to me because theyre already controlled by government because they dont have room like i do at home \\s therapist: to avoid that in future because it didnt really it didnt really work you werent able to to help them understand whats going on \\s patient: while people dont understand whats going on then thats their fault thats their problem they should have listened to me i could actually gave them technology that they needed to actually create room so that government cant hear them \\s therapist: but they werent open to that idea \\s patient: no quite opposite it completely opposite \\s therapist: how are your family relationships \\s patient: okay yeah we live with my mom she does that shes supposed to she doesnt go in my room because she knows that she goes into robots gonna mess up technology so she stays out \\s therapist: so you get along through okay anybody else you have contact with friends family \\s patient: i talk to people all time but they are in my head we have conversations all time about how we can actually make world better place then how we can actually go through then destroy government or do good just pump it up \\s therapist: jason well im sorry to hear that youre under stress im glad to hear your feel like its okay youre not down or anxious or anything this answer these questions for me this has been helpful im going to recommend you continue to see counselor here if thats okay i realize your court ordered didnt come through \\s patient: that would be good \\s therapist: well then ill put on schedule well set time up front where ill see

            "therapist: hello stone \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: hi im pj daniels sorry let me wash my hands \\s patient: call me dorothy \\s therapist: oh thank you thats next thing i was going to ask you so dorothy nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care but whats going on \\s patient: five days ago i was admitted to emergency they treated me by putting this tube down my throat i tried to to tell them gesture at them that i dont want this tube down my throat i just hope that never happens again \\s therapist: okay no i totally understand that i mean that quite scary thing to go through i think we do need to talk about this more im glad that youve asked it talk to me about this so i had little bit of look through your charts i think i understand why they did it but did anybody explain it to you \\s patient: well not really because i was gasping for air in state i was but ill tell you what im really worried that this wont happen to me again i dont want that to be anymore im im okay to to pass this \\s therapist: absolutely you know what theres no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive like two we really want to know what patient values in terms of you know things that are that invasive so absolutely will respect whatever it that you want but i do need to find out little bit more about you in terms of what your understanding of what brought you into hospital \\s patient: well i have congested part failure i guess there was water in my lungs stopping me from breathing properly so i was living in my soul ambulance brought me in to emergency so they that was how they were treating me \\s therapist: so you pretty much showed up to emergency very quickly they put that tube down \\s patient: thats correct \\s therapist: did anybody ask you if you were okay with that \\s patient: well i tried to gesture to them that i dont want tube but \\s therapist: they didnt quite pick up on that \\s patient: i guess not you know ive had that three times already i dont want to go through with \\s therapist: two youve had \\s patient: yes i dont want it anymore \\s therapist: okay so so you have congestive heart failure it sounds like youve got breathing problem yes do you know why they would have put tube down do you know what they were trying to do \\s patient: i guess because i was short of air i had hard time breathing right so they tried to like im going to use word save me \\s therapist: right so it sounds like you understand that i mean usually we only put tube in if that was only thing we could do to save you most of time of congestive heart failure well give some medications have you heard of lasix or furosemide no okay its medication will often give if someone in heart failure but if someone really sick then we dont think we have time to give it thats time we would think of breathing tube havent had chance to look through chart but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in \\s patient: i i guess so but im okay with dying okay you know like i says ive lived good life if it if good lord says that its my time im okay with that you wouldnt put it to \\s therapist: no my know already what im hearing from you exactly im just gonna say exactly what youve said sounds like youve lived good life youve been through this few times you know exactly what it involves if i could paraphrase to you quality of life more important than quantity at this stage that correct \\s patient: that correct but you know what doctor how can i be assured that my wishes are respected so i dont get this tube down \\s therapist: thats an excellent question so first i did want to answer your previous question based on what were talking about absolutely i agree with you that it your wish we will respect that wish that were not going to put breathing tube down again then of course your second question which great as well as how do we make sure this doesnt happen so what im going to do after our conversation i do have few more questions to ask you but after conversation i write note documenting what we talked about that we talked about breathing too your reasons for why you dont want it which of course makes sense to me then what i do i document short form called goals of care i just so its really easy way for everyone to look at form in two seconds i know exactly what you want we will give you copy of that to take home but i find thats not usually enough what we also do what i do i tend to when you leave hospital dictate note to your family doctor that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in alberta in that note will very clearly state you i have this conversation you really didnt want breathing to so i reassure you well do everything we can to make sure people understand you dont want that to okay \\s patient: all thank you im i was so concerned about that yes i i think i will rest now because like i say that was horrendous experience he says it wont happen again \\s therapist: okay i do want to ask you just few other questions related to this go ahead first question might sound little off putting but i sort of have to ask it anytime someone changing kind of therapy they want we do have to ask how was your mood how are you feeling \\s patient: im im feeling fine my mood fine i have no no problems \\s therapist: okay excellent how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital like when youre healthy as healthy as you can be say few weeks ago \\s patient: i think i am enjoying life okay yes i am enjoying life to to best i can \\s therapist: okay great yeah then other related questions we did talk about two that we wouldnt put it in but again we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want okay so if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better that something youd be willing to have \\s patient: certainly oh yes oh look at medication just not intubation \\s therapist: okay then usually along lines with intubation when people dont want intubation we often also want to know if nurse were to walk into room find just by bad luck you would pass away or if someone just found you at home who had passed away would you ever want people pushing on your chest giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life \\s patient: no no no i like i said good lord knows when its my time \\s therapist: no thatll make sense to me with no breathing \\s patient: yes i have no problems with that \\s therapist: there are some other things we can do thats not breathing tube but theyre little aggressive one have you ever heard of bipap \\s patient: i dont think so \\s therapist: its mass that really pushes air into you its little uncomfortable but nothing as bad as breathing tube maybe hard to answer this question because you dont know what that but to have any thoughts on that if you were really sick if we were to try just mask we would do it just as long as you were okay with it comfortable at time \\s patient: would it be for long time \\s therapist: now usually most times with bipap its only about two to six hours for most patients \\s patient: yeah that would be okay with me okay if \\s therapist: we had to put large ivs lines into your wrist stuff take you to intensive care unit again we wouldnt do breathing too but this just to watch you closely \\s patient: yeah i would be okay with that yes yes it doesnt sound invasive to me \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: no i just needed to be reassured that that it wont happen again yeah im i know that on my chart its there yes yes thats all i need to hear because i was concerned okay \\s therapist: i do want to say that this not set in stone in sense that if you ever change your mind we can have conversation again but if we dont hear from you this what will go with no breathing to no registered in heart i just want you to know that in case anything were to change \\s patient: okay so if i change my mind i can i will talk to you \\s therapist: absolutely \\s patient: i dont think ill change \\s therapist: i dont think you will either but its just nice to see that youre aware of that okay um honestly i mean theres some other questions i tend to ask people when i dont know them well just kind of routine stuff okay maybe well just quickly go through it go your medical history heart failure anything else \\s patient: um thats it im beginning with an ass but i cant remember what it \\s therapist: okay thats okay we can usually we have it written down yeah your medications i think i saw youre on aspirin two jocks i think two others do you happen to know or have them written down \\s patient: you dont want i always carry this paper with me because i cant remember name so okay \\s therapist: oh so you are on water pill furosemide okay \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: okay great yeah um any allergies \\s patient: no \\s therapist: okay i wont ask but anything that runs in your family given your age they told me youre 70 that correct \\s patient: that correct \\s therapist: yes i do have to ask following questions completely unrelated to what were talking about thats okay do you smoke at all \\s patient: no i dont \\s therapist: drink any alcohol \\s patient: no no \\s therapist: okay this will be sound crazy but i have to ask any street drugs illegal drugs anything like that \\s patient: no i never had opportunity \\s therapist: to test any over counter herbals in addition to these \\s patient: no i dont take any of those \\s therapist: where are you living right now \\s patient: im living in convalescent home for last six months i used to live in my own home six months ago im moved to convalescent home \\s therapist: okay how do you feel about that that changed six months ago \\s patient: i would really prefer my own home but just trouble with my breathing sometimes right \\s therapist: so you feeling better about being in that place now new home \\s patient: its okay okay i really have to adjust like i say if i had my druthers id go back but i guess i have to learn to adjust to this right okay \\s therapist: so i think i sort of have all information i need to make sure that your wishes are respected just one last time anything else you want to talk about today \\s patient: oh you answered my question i was so worried about this tube \\s therapist: okay all right well its very nice to meet you stone \\s patient: thank you",

            "therapist: hi you how to do it today \\s patient: great how are you \\s therapist: im doing well thanks for asking \\s therapist: so youre doing great \\s patient: im doing awesome \\s therapist: i know your brother brought you in today he had expressed some concerns about your mood do you know what thats about \\s patient: i i think hes worrying for no reason because i you know i for last like week half i have been following my passion which baking i didnt realize this before because i worked in an office i just realized that thats not what i want to do with my life i know what i want to do with my life now ive never known before so this an amazing feeling what i want to do i want to start my own baking business so what happened was that couple two weeks ago my nephew had bake sale ive always ive always been like baking but ive always been like from box or like from you know whatever so i tried for first time making brownies from scratch they were amazing everyone loved them at bake sale they sold out my nephew thought i was hero basically i was so now it made me realize like i could do this for living it would make me feel amazing make me feel like hero for all these people like my college campus would be kind of cool if i could like put up something about like delivering bakery like dorms or like big goods to dorms because you know college students love that type of thing but so anyway so i was thinking about long story short having this business i would bake all these cookies i was gonna put up flyers because i dont im not like at point where i can get like an office space but i dont need an office space because i have my apartment i have everything i need in my apartment to bake everything i need i can also have bjs membership so go to bjs i can get everything i need in bulk so like all flour butter sugar all that stuff so its not an issue if i just do it from my apartment so i was putting up flyers trying to promote my business has really been working on for last week half i feel great its amazing thats basically it \\s therapist: alright so you feel like everythings kind of going your way hmm youre really excited about new business idea i know that your brother was little concerned with how much youve been spending on business idea he mentioned some things about different relationships youve had that are new \\s patient: okay so theres couple that with that so with spending like i dont think my brother recognizes that when you start business like you need to invest in it to begin i understand why hes worried because like so at work well at office job that i had like i got in trouble because i obviously you need to make fires i was like oh like he doesnt realize im frugal im smart so i was like ill make fires at work put them out of work computer so that im not having to pay like wherever like staples or something to go print them out for me so i got in trouble because it was like for personal use i was using like work whatever but like thats what annoys me about it because like new guy that i met which other thing with relationships like this new guy so supportive of my ideas i met him actually in bakery which like destiny he was so supportive when i told him about what i was planning actually other guy that i was talking to before ive been talking to him for while he was kind of like my brother was like are you sure this something you want to do like i dont understand why you would say that someone whos obviously sure of what they want to do like i know i can do it i know that ill be successful like did they not taste brownies at bake sale like they were amazing so thats kind of where i am thats why my brothers worried but he shouldnt be because like i have all this played out \\s therapist: hes worried that you dont want to think this was new relationship you dont know guy too well \\s patient: i mean ive hooked up with him few times like i know him pretty well i dont think he understands like connection that we have i guess pretty strong one \\s therapist: so your brother just doesnt in your mind he just doesnt get it \\s patient: no like he doesnt like pay attention to me when i talk like ill be trying to tell him about like bake sale or not bake sale well little bit about bake sale i can try to tell him about how successful it was he just thought that i was like bragging but i wasnt like it was genuinely like success then i tried to tell him about my business idea like hes like trying to like brush it off like its not good idea thats why so he just doesnt listen to me so sometimes i try not to talk too much about it \\s therapist: have you noticed through all this any change in sleep patterns \\s patient: i havent been sleeping as much but i think thats just because im so excited about this like so ive been like staying up late waking up early like looking at recipes honestly hasnt really been an issue because i havent been tired at all i was really i havent eat i felt rested i get enough \\s therapist: notice you do feel rested you havent been sleeping as much \\s patient: no \\s therapist: you clearly seem like youre in good mood no no sadness right now at that \\s patient: like im not gonna have sadness when youre following your passion \\s therapist: should be doing pretty well that way have you ever been down or depressed \\s

to be down i dont have any of that stuff like i feel so much more hopeful happy just great with where my life going right now \\s therapist: do you ever feel this way before kind of in really good \\s patient: no \\s therapist: no nothing like this \\s therapist: what do you think about all this one \\s patient: honestly i just think its like getting to know myself getting to know like what i want to do which this you know culinary arts \\s therapist: its kind of realizing that its kind of changed my life \\s patient: for better for like really for better \\s therapist: all right you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work \\s therapist: right how bad that turned out \\s patient: pretty bad like i it was like final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me

saving anything like that \\s patient: no \\s therapist: are you seeing or hearing anything that other people cant see or hear \\s patient: no \\s therapist: no like that sure so i know that youre feeling pretty well but i would like you to see counselor maybe help you as you contemplate these different things weve been talking about if youd be if youd be okay with talking to counselor \\s

            "The patient says that her husband believes she has trouble with anger. But the patient says they are fine and they just yell here and there to get the point across. The patient claims their husband has to deal with it and that's how she gets work done. The patient's husband believes she should get help but patient thinks it is not their problem. The patient feels that they have to yell because their husband does not listen to them, and wouldn't have to yell if their husband heard it the first time. The arguments happen spontaneously. The patient feels things are fine when thier husband is listening. This is causing distress in their relationship. The patient has no medical condition, does not use drugs or alcohol, nor have any mental health history. The therapist sets up the patient with the counselor in a couple days. "

            "therapist: hey jill how are you doing today \\s patient: i am all right im little bit stressed out right now \\s therapist: little stressed whats going on \\s patient: well as you know im in graduate program right now im just really coming to near end of my program im just finding it increasingly difficult im just really stressed with how things have been going \\s therapist: okay weve talked about some different struggles youve had as you balance work school everything what specifically bothering now it seems like youre little more distressed today \\s patient: well i dont i dont i dont really know its just i am as ive told you before i take school really seriously i really strive to do well well in school well on my assignments i just feel like im not performing as well as i needed to \\s therapist: what kind of grades youve been getting lately \\s patient: well ive been getting as \\s therapist: anything else \\s patient: no \\s therapist: okay thats usually considered pretty good right \\s patient: yeah i just feel like its getting harder to get as \\s therapist: okay youre working hard to get same grade \\s patient: right it used to be so easy for me to do what my teachers expect to get good grades now i feel like its its really struggle im not doing as well as i need to im constantly worried about not doing this well \\s therapist: have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance \\s patient: my teachers all seem to think im doing well they actually i see to get good feedback on my assignments but i feel like i feel like i just to make sure im doing well i really focus on like details like making sure that instructions are really clear like im doing everything like perfectly as an instructure instructor wants because im really afraid that you know if im not really clear on what assignment then maybe i wont do it right way \\s therapist: alright so before when you got as you were working hard to have job but not to level of precision in terms of like detail in assignment that you are now youre trying to get more information about assignments youre working harder to get same grade that used to get before \\s patient: right like i find myself like emailing teacher like almost like obsessively like trying to to clarify assignment to make sure do they think im doing well in class what not \\s therapist: so when youre when youre having this feeling that i guess its feeling of anxiety or stress yeah whats going through your mind what are you thinking about \\s patient: well i guess im just feeling that you know ive worked really hard this whole program i dont want to mess it up now or you know because if i dont get these grades i feel like what was use if i met then im going to be ruining all this hard work that ive done this whole program if i kind of if i dont maintain that level of you know like you said precision i feel like like that ive let myself down or that im failure because im i just slacked off at end of program its so close to being done \\s therapist: so what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failed \\s patient: probably less than an anything other than \\s therapist: right below an isnt minus \\s patient: i mean i guess i would be okay with that but i wouldnt be really happy with it \\s therapist: what about plus \\s patient: i wouldnt be that excited about that \\s therapist: b \\s patient: i wouldnt be happy with that \\s therapist: no no itd be worse okay so an you can tolerate an minus youre not exactly sure but you think you could \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but b plus b \\s patient: to me like like an minus i would maybe be okay with but like below that like to me like b whether its like b minus b b plus its all b thats not an \\s therapist: so what would it mean to you if you received b \\s patient: that i didnt try hard enough but theres something else i could have done to to do better that i was like slacking or i didnt read directions right or i didnt have enough responses or make my paper long enough i just didnt do enough \\s therapist: but you didnt try hard enough that you didnt do enough what would it mean if that were true \\s patient: if i didnt try hard enough that i was lazy \\s therapist: that you were lazy \\s patient: yeah that i could have tried harder i didnt so why didnt i try i didnt maybe i didnt care i was lazy kind of like whats use if youre not gonna try your best why try it all \\s therapist: okay now we weve talked before about automatic thoughts cognitive distortions right in other sessions one of cognitive distortions this idea that unuseful type of thinking aaron thinking when you think of everything in terms of like black or white all or nothing so sounds like you have little tolerance for like an minus youre not completely there but generally its kind of an of some type right or youre not interested right so we get down to you didnt try hard enough if that were true new would be lazy right which you know having senior these last few sessions clear to me youre not lazy but thats body \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: now it seems that earlier in your earlier years in program this was acer effortless for you but youd have to work as hard for them \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: whats what do you think has changed \\s patient: im not quite sure like it didnt stress me out as much in beginning of program like i really like school but now i feel like im static because its anxiety producing for me because you know im constantly worried \\s therapist: you mentioned part of it was you can get close to end right so there anything else \\s patient: well only thing i can think of we have same students throughout our program but i guess this semester theres new student in program i know that you mentioned it seems like shes kind of really stressing me out also well see throughout program i kind of considered myself like to be student who got best grades theres this award at end of program for doing really well i kind of made it goal of mine to get this award at end because i felt like that would show that i really tried hard this program really meant lot to me i think you know it would show people who viewed did that you know i really busted my butt did good job in this program for whole program so far you know that was me like that was i was kind of front runner i guess for this award this semester theres new student then come to find out like she had 40 in her other program so \\s therapist: so if im reading you right you you really didnt have any competition for this award that you were aware of right now you feel like you really do \\s patient: right like i feel like pressures on like i felt like i tried so hard this whole program now like this new person comes in she might want different me so i really need to go above beyond to make sure that im still on track \\s therapist: im paradoxically thats caused you to be more anxious more stressed your performing but youre still getting as which are working harder to get as \\s patient: right its causing me lot of anxiety with school where its not as enjoyable for me as it once was \\s therapist: so what would it mean if you couldnt get award if you didnt with whats name of new was first name with new choice choice okay but of choice once award you didnt want me \\s patient: i guess part of me feels like them why did i do program if you know part of me feels like if youre not going to be best why try so if if she got award over me then its kind of like why did i work so hard this whole time like i could have been slacking this whole time just skated by so why did i bust my butt if it was all for nothing i dont have anything to show for it \\s therapist: so its all or nothing if you dont win award \\s patient: i mean i guess its not only thing that matters so part of me feels that way sometimes that i have these thoughts that if i dont try my hardest do well win this award then why do i try so hard rest of time but like it negates all positive things this that this you know kind of like end result like if you tried hard whole race then you lose you know at end \\s therapist: right but youre not really losing race because you would still graduate \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre youre just not getting word which you would like right which would be great right certainly accomplishment but reason you came to program was to get degree \\s patient: right even know about award until probably like second year anyway so that wasnt reason i entered but \\s therapist: but its now its now taken on some importance for you winning award has been real goal \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so with new student choice coming in i have this increased competition \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats causing me anxiety caused you to work hard for same grade all right so as we talked before you have tendency to be i mean this as compliment little perfectionistic right i dont think its necessarily bad thing it taking too far it can be right it can be not useful ever hear phrase perfect enemy of good no does that make sense what that might mean \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: yeah so this desire to be perfect or to win award potentially causing you not even to perform well right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: youre still getting as but its called anxiety youre working hard \\s patient: right now im not even i feel like when i read like im so stressed with it from reading right thing memorizing every word that im not retaining all information so it could its starting to like impact school \\s therapist: so there any way that you cannot win award still walk away having accomplished worthy goals or does it have to be award or none of this was worth it \\s patient: i mean it kind of sounds silly when you when youre reflecting it back to me how you know that i have to read words like i i think that it makes sense you know that wasnt my goal going into it you know why does it matter so much to me that theres different degrees of success i think if youve said before that not all about award i think i would be happy with just you know getting degree all stuff that ive learned i would feel like it was if i didnt get award rather i would feel like it was still worthwhile journey but in moment sometimes its really upsetting at thought of not getting award but thats possibility \\s therapist: your word validates all hard work youve done \\s patient: right exactly \\s therapist: in your mind losing award invalidates all hard work youve done right but in reality theres probably between ground there might have been shade of gray where youre still an excellent student you still graduate you just dont have an extra plaque hanging on wall whatever word right thats really all youd be missing right \\s patient: yep \\s therapist: with this award have any impact on employment \\s patient: i dont think so i am thinking about i dont think of long term many people would know about it besides me or if i put it you know on resume or something but i dont think it would make that much of difference \\s therapist: you didnt know about it when you first came in youre already working hard \\s patient: right at beginning i didnt even know about it \\s therapist: so in sense of course we cant do this for sense of you could forget about award right you probably win it \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: because youre already doing so well but thought of this potential failure right away word thats holding you back \\s patient: right it makes me it makes me paranoid to make mistakes or to try take risks or to really you know do well because im so worried about judgment like from my teachers if im doing well enough \\s therapist: yeah theres no theres no tolerance for any type of mistake \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: so so now that with award out there you really feel like you cant make any type of mistake or you just go right to to catastrophe \\s patient: right like im walking on eggshells im just expecting my grades to tank if i if i kind of like deviate from that line \\s therapist: so free so for you to feel better about this one way i guess right would be to not help have to not place so much value in way \\s patient: its really hard \\s therapist: yeah you really want that it would be great thats okay right we talked about adaptive responses before right what are whats your automatic thought you have when youre sitting there trying to get every assignment right you youre kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was automatic thought that comes to mind \\s patient: if im you if i want when im just doing work \\s therapist: yeah when youre doing your work you sense that anxiety come on right as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award right like its losing it really whats going through your mind right that moment \\s patient: i guess im just kind of like running through checklist did i do this did i do this did i do this making sure i did everything that was expected of me \\s therapist: to ensure that youre gonna get that award \\s patient: right \\s therapist: right so at higher level one of your thoughts i must win that award \\s patient: right \\s therapist: does that make sense i mean that thats probably somewhere there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment that statement or kind of well thats an absolute statement right i must win that award there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought \\s patient: that i must win award \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: i guess i could say that you know this award something local to my university no ones going to know about it in grand scheme of things so it wont really impact future employment or what my colleagues think of me you know if i if i dont get award that they wont think less of me \\s therapist: okay so so you could say itd be nice to win award but in end its not really gonna make difference in my life in terms of my career \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats fair adaptive response right you do want to win it right truthfully it would be nice to win it right who doesnt want to win award right but if you dont you were still good student youre still gonna be good connection your career still good before do you believe in that adaptive response do you believe that adaptive response true \\s patient: i feel like sometimes i do then sometimes its really hard in heat of moment to kind of talk myself down from that that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment right im not doing well im going to get to be in this class im going to lose this award so i feel like it starts its hard in moment to spiral out of that \\s therapist: so what percentage of time do you believe that adaptive response true \\s patient: maybe like half time \\s therapist: so 50 of time \\s patient: right depends on whats going on in my stress \\s therapist: other half youre not really buying \\s patient: right \\s therapist: okay all right so what advice well lets use choice right choices in same situation in sense in that shes well maybe not knowing what she working toward this award as well \\s patient: i dont even know she knows about award \\s therapist: lets assume lets assume she knows about it right hes in similar situation what advice would you give her shes kind of obsessing about this in same way that you are \\s patient: yeah i think i would tell her that you know rest of class sees that shes doing well her teachers give her positive feedback so all science would point towards that youre doing really well youre being very successful in program that youre getting positive feedback from them so that all signs feedback telling you youre doing really good job \\s therapist: your advice to her seems positive uplifting mostly your advice to her more positive uplifting what youre telling yourself internally \\s patient: definitely it \\s therapist: so if that advices adequate i feel it adequate appropriate for her why isnt it adequate probably for you \\s patient: i dont know sometimes i feel like i just hold myself to higher standard than i hold other people to like if some friend of mine like joyce would come tell me same situation you know id be able to give her whole bunch of you know suggestions or some positive feedback but its really hard for me sometimes because i hold myself to higher standard than other people \\s therapist: but you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me useful right but youre just having trouble applying that to yourself \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: smooth thats what you need to work on bit so you can kind of see logic of all this but your feelings dont match \\s patient: correct makes sense in my head i would know what to tell someone else but i dont always believe it when i say to myself \\s therapist: alright so heres what i want you to do you familiar with thought record that i introduced you in first session where you can outline your situation your feelings youve explained all this to me i want you to actually complete one thought records \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: i know after having set it all might seem like doubling work but i think its something changes when you write something down okay i have to face it on paper also its good tool to remember exactly what youre thinking then work through adaptive response section their smiles at bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response maybe write out few different ones but theres plenty of room on forum you see it right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats actually largest grid cell one on adaptive responses that responses dont have to be short like yours wasnt short theres really good they can they can be long they can so be realistic like id like to win it would be good to win but alice should have to be successful \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: i thinl adaptive response kicked out to downside of not having success okay it doesnt have to be completely positive okay has to be realistic useful as importantly you have to believe it okay theres place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in okay i know well look at that from week to week you know as we move closer to your graduation hopefully itll bring you some relief for missing anxiety \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: thats sounds like good plan \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: thanks \\s patient: thanks",

in my everyday life \\s therapist: lot of anger yeah can you give me some examples \\s patient: like for instance \\s patient: i go to dry cleaner pickup my fiances uniforms lady had them like ball bag together i mean i could have easily just asked her because she separate them but i begin to yell caused big commotion because i was so frustrated angry she actually was about to call police escort me out i dont think im even allowed to go back to driveway anymore \\s therapist: so quite bit of anger \\s patient: yeah my neighbors dog was barking late at night i know my neighbors when they cant

i just get little things just i just explode \\s patient: so i dont know why \\s therapist: did anything change around time that i started \\s patient: nothing that i can really think of just when im overwhelmed i have so much to do i kind of just break down just become extremely upset with everything around me \\s therapist: alright so youre getting upset you have some anger \\s therapist: any other time that youre feeling angry \\s patient: when i go to go workout at kickboxing class im like go all out like i use that as like release im punching bags of shame before i actually had hurt my wrist last week i just go all out in there my trainer kind of notices like are you okay im like its just relief kind of gained all anger i had been out so \\s therapist: alright so that experience for you you feel like youre releasing more energy than maybe other people in game can wait \\s patient: you are way more im like loud im sweating bullets im just going all out like extremely angry \\s therapist: alright so \\s therapist: in recent memory your anger has increased but its still not really clear whats going on thats causing anger \\s patient: not really i just feel like frustrated does have so much going on at moment so its kind of like just feel overwhelmed i guess not take it out \\s therapist: you feel busy like in your daily life like lot of responsibilities \\s patient: yes whole lot \\s therapist: what kind of things youre doing \\s patient: mainly mainly take care of home does not mean i dont i dont work or anything so i kind of just take care of home you know with kids everything its just lot so \\s therapist: see lot of responsibilities in home \\s patient: guess all of responsibilities all \\s patient: it feels like all of them yeah \\s therapist: what type things are you doing \\s patient: im cooking im cleaning \\s patient: now i have to earn all of my husbands uniforms get everything ready for him i had to make sure i cook breakfast i had to make sure

really dont get break or any other help just made every day \\s therapist: youre doing everything has always been this way \\s patient: not always but it seems its been like this for some time \\s therapist: okay where youre really just doing everything in home \\s patient: everything \\s therapist: i want to ask you \\s therapist: can i ask you or mention few words right i would like you to if youre okay with this exercise tell me first thing that comes to mind like you can buy say word you can offer several responses but try not to invest lot of thought into response more just what occurs to you oh but does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so first word \\s patient: structure responsibility \\s patient: repetition \\s therapist: repetition \\s therapist: all right let me give you another word relationship \\s patient: conflict power struggle \\s patient: disagreements \\s therapist: let me offer you another word \\s therapist: work \\s patient: independence \\s patient: freedom \\s patient: able to express creativity \\s therapist: good alright how about another word here power \\s patient: of constant struggle \\s patient: extremely controlling \\s therapist: so do you see any \\s therapist: themes in words that you provided back \\s patient: seems like everything like really controlled \\s patient: structured \\s therapist: controlled structured \\s therapist: whats source of that controlling structure there source of it \\s patient: lot of it may come from my fiance now that im thinking about it \\s therapist: somebody told me youre thinking \\s patient: because i feel that he doesnt give me freedom or ability to do lot of things that i would like to do like work i think he should help more with kids around house do things i shouldnt have to do everything i feel like thats probably why im so frustrated because i felt that i dont have any help its like im single im doing everything on my own so this project where bulk of my frustration coming from \\s therapist: so as youre telling me this youre explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance what are you feeling \\s patient: im feeling angry disappointed like i dont really know if i want to further anything because well itd be like this forever just like angry frustrated \\s therapist: similar to anger that youve been experiencing recently like at dry cleaner places \\s patient: its far worse than it but its like i think thats where why im always so upset angry \\s therapist: serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship whats really causing anger \\s patient: yeah cuz i feel alone at same time completely like im not in fair relationship like im in control i dont have freedom to do anything i dont have help its just its laying lot of stress on me \\s therapist: so this your talk about this do you feel like this new information youre kind of realizing something that you didnt realize before \\s patient: it because honestly i kind of i never really focused on that aspect of it i kind of just thought thats way it should go i just thought i was angry because i just hate bad deeds ive never really looked deep into it because i try so hard to make everything in my family right so i kind of really dont pay attention i kind of ignore it but now that im thinking pointing out different things than into how i really feel \\s therapist: so you feel this this kind of big moment in terms of awareness \\s patient: definitely because i dont think i would have like i said i think im kind of try to hide it really dont focus much on it because i want things to be perfect so they got kind of ignore it \\s therapist: okay so maybe through this session you develop more insight about whats contributing to anger \\s patient: yeah definitely cuz i would just go off for no reason at all just later to think about like why did i even do it \\s therapist: but but this source of anchor this relationship you recognize this maybe more causal or more contributing yeah wheres other objects of your ad if you werent really sure \\s patient: i wasnt sure at all why but with that i definitely could see reasons why \\s therapist: all right chess move i feel like weve made some progress here id like you to between now next session if youre comfortable with it kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to surface what informations may have been revealed to you little bit we can pick up there explore this further with anger issue so thats like good plan \\s patient: yeah definitely definitely its good \\s therapist: well i appreciate you coming in today ill see you in week okay thank you",

            "therapist: are you doing today \\s patient: okay how are you \\s therapist: im doing well thanks for asking \\s patient: yes um i would like to be able to kind of ive been feeling little depressed i would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know depression \\s therapist: so reduce feelings of depression yes thatd be cool okay yes so sounds like good goal so what objectives what tasks do you think that you could do that would help you to feel less depressed \\s patient: i guess maybe some sort of physical activity maybe like walking i like to be outside so maybe walking could be one okay \\s therapist: have you had plan before we have walked regularly \\s patient: you know i used to i did it was it was it was it would give me some relief because i was i was able to clear my mind whenever i was walking so i yes yes ive had success with walking before \\s therapist: so walking has worked before \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: you notice that youre walking less since youve had first impression i \\s patient: really havent been doing too much of anything ive just been kind of at home doing homework stressing out over doing getting homework done because im you know back in school its been so stressful overwhelming you know like i said its just kind of gotten me in this little funk this depressed mood so \\s therapist: since youre on topic of homework which something you think you can do there you mentioned that its stressful overwhelming that sounds like type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes mm hmm do you find that kind of being stressed about homework \\s patient: yeah because you know theres so much work to be done sometimes good you know several assignments do at same time i find myself rushing to get assignments you know it can just be little daunting its just overwhelming sometimes so yeah i dont know maybe if i spaced that out you know took you know did some time management or something like that i dont know to kind of help me \\s therapist: feel like maybe youre starting homework late compared to when its due \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: thats feeling maybe of overwhelmed \\s patient: yes i would say that \\s therapist: so yeah youre right it sounds like this just an organizational thing right so if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier do it in small bits okay instead of me waiting more or less last minute right that would reduce mean likely i would think reduce some of stressed feelings of being overwhelmed \\s patient: im sure it would you sure would \\s therapist: so one make that your sec objective then so you have walking okay then youll have trying to space out homework \\s patient: okay that sounds doable \\s therapist: sound good all right \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: what other objectives might work \\s patient: lets see \\s therapist: that worked in past for you \\s patient: you know it was something that i enjoyed doing right now i feel like im not doing any of things that ive enjoyed doing because ive been so busy doing work doing homework so i think that would probably help \\s therapist: so its good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: it has kind of come in singing parts fun for it sounds like but also theres social component seems like \\s patient: yes it it enjoy access to enjoy singing you know i enjoy people that i was saying with we will go hang out together go to different you know like jazz clubs or events you know different bands that were playing it you know itll just be nice its fun i love music so i love listening to it i love you know singing so making music so that was great i think that would be good goal \\s therapist: you seem to kind of light up little when you talk about singing \\s patient: yes its i i just love it i enjoy doing it i just havent had chance to deal with lightning \\s therapist: so far this justmaking time \\s patient: yes yeah yes \\s therapist: good all right so well make that third objective so we have walking kind of organizing your homework differently then singing that that socializing its companies that that singing thats great so three objectives good i try to get to four if you have one there fourth objective that you can think of something else that youve associated with not feeling depressed when \\s patient: i used to absolutely love going to beach visiting with my aunt so thats two things beach i love beach because its soothing its company i my shes just such an awesome person shes always pouring into me i just love spending time with her so she lives down to pitch \\s therapist: yes she does okay so this seems like good good objective to yes so youre suggesting maybe visiting her more often \\s patient: yes again just at home doing homework i havent gone to visit her in while thing she only lives like an hour away so its not its not right no its not so thats like you know trip i couldnt do on saturday take break go down there spend some time with that will be i think that will be helpful \\s therapist: so again kind of kind of getting away from school stressors just take taking break from it for day yes then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with good good all right so i want to go through each one of these just make sure that were kind of meeting all criteria for an objective which i think we can do but these are all specific which good do you feel these are all achievable these are things you can do i think so yeah yeah well someone that knew done in past right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so now we have specific achievable i dont want to get too personal more tricky which making it measurable i like to do here i dont want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives i want you to decide but i want to see we can quantify in some manner how often youll be able to do these different things or how you know quite like homer but to think about spacing would be quantity but but first with walking so in given week say whats realistic for you in terms of getting out walking how many times \\s patient: um maybe i can start out with twice week twice quickly \\s therapist: okay do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities arent too great you have that opportunity \\s patient: maybe we need to start with one day week \\s therapist: okay lets go one day one time one time week lets talk with one then well see what happens \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so what day of week are you thinking \\s patient: about monday \\s therapist: consider window of opportunity you see on monday \\s patient: it yeah plus it just kind of i think no no how about wednesday \\s therapist: wednesday \\s patient: yes wednesday middle of week stress from work school yes wednesday sounds good \\s therapist: once you have particular time range you like to walk few times day \\s patient: like 630 \\s therapist: thats good time for you as time you can get out of house \\s patient: yes off work give me little bit of time to get home change out door because if i if i make it too late im not going to go \\s therapist: 630 kind of good thats good time yeah 630 good so well start with that objective walking every wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with so homework little trickier right this about spacing it out okay so homework assignments theyre stressing you out how much time did they take last few few questions how much time do they take to complete generally like an hour so \\s patient: it depends on assignment \\s therapist: if you had average of \\s patient: average two hours \\s therapist: lets go to worst case lets go two half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be worst case \\s patient: maybe it depends because \\s therapist: when we get three \\s patient: yeah second \\s therapist: two to three hours okay then how much time do you have when its assigned to when its due usually \\s patient: maybe couple of weeks \\s therapist: couple weeks yeah \\s patient: i get distracted so little distracted so its you know i start reading ill fall asleep or i get distracted by something then before you know it time gone im rushing at end to get it shown up to try get it all done \\s therapist: so i was ready to do work to ease into last okay yeah i could see how that would be stressful what day of week isnt usually sunday \\s patient: on tuesdays on tuesdays \\s therapist: so you have tuesday then you have another tuesday week after that you have three hours of work those two weeks \\s patient: shipping okay \\s therapist: yeah will be first day time but kind of like when you specified wednesday 630 thats gonna be walking time right right at time you can start homework because first time \\s patient: im come back from my walk on wednesdays \\s therapist: how long do you foresee \\s patient: well normally only half an hour \\s therapist: so to get some time to decompress round alright so from eight to nine on tuesday or wednesday on wednesday youll get first third of homework then then just stop okay thatd be thatd be done for night okay all right thats some big plans how about that second hour \\s patient: ill get started \\s therapist: thursday so its just one day apart \\s patient: yeah thats due thursday \\s therapist: oh do come thursday yeah an hour yes what hour do you have in mind \\s patient: thursdays \\s therapist: so but 7070 so one night wednesday be at nine oclock then on thursday seven nine was two hours seven days sorry okay so now just last hour remains \\s patient: sunday sunday \\s therapist: through sunday okay so you you want to get everything done from tuesday to sunday night yeah rest of that time off yeah okay okay sure thats achievable that seems like youre youre getting lot in there but you think you can do it \\s patient: i can try okay yeah \\s therapist: that sounds good all right what time sunday \\s patient: sunday around five \\s therapist: to five to six five to six \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: im assuming it wont run over because we kind of have to be on high side but if it did i would be able to go five to seven so thats kind of like yeah flexible time there yes so what would that feel like to get your homework done \\s patient: but it would be relief \\s therapist: okay so theres potential backup plan i see in here that if something happens on sunday where you need more time you dont want to stress you still have that wednesday after you walk bacon yeah so that could be like your your backup yes that makes sense yes because you still have another six days to have done after that right all right so all those seem realistic achievable \\s patient: it does \\s therapist: every so many fridays \\s patient: every friday \\s therapist: so so this this isnt every friday commitment right this thing \\s patient: yeah but one friday generally its maybe \\s therapist: about two hours two hours so two hours every friday theres something really enjoyed though so it sounds like you look forward to it yeah so friday two hours i guess yes afternoon or evening evening okay \\s patient: yeah i mean if i if it was something that came up that i really had to get done not like i cant not go so it wont be managed right \\s therapist: yeah good okay so that was last objective this this i guess about whole day commitment right because you go to beach its an hour drive so you probably wouldnt want to go down for just few hours more like whole day would they \\s patient: that would be more like saturday but of course it wouldnt be every saturday \\s therapist: so how many times say month like once once month okay so you go down on saturday morning come back \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: thats something to look forward to yes that something that would be okay in terms of like because on friday night potentially youd be out right then saturday \\s patient: yeah if i if all those saturdays that i know that im going i could not be out too late on that \\s therapist: okay thats good idea so you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out yes when you know that saturday coming \\s patient: or not go at all thats fine either way \\s therapist: just take break that time yes restore all right so thats four separate objectives what i want to do since ive kind of made lot of specific notations here i want to take moment just take break print this up for you okay well work on rest of your goals next time but i want you to have this so you can get started on it right away so before i print these up as changes you want to make \\s patient: um i would like to try that \\s therapist: if it doesnt work can we tweak oh yeah we can always make changes maybe certain things will work really well it certain things well have to take off list altogether maybe substitute something else yeah we can we can make edits to it whole time youre here okay we can just make document that changes as as needed but if you think its good starting place ill go print this up as it give you copy we can resume with todays session then next time i see in week or call rest of treatment plan beside plan yes thanks allison \\s patient: thank you",

not drug right this doesnt matter how my face i get this constantly yes always there \\s therapist: okay i guess reason i was checking i think weve picked up on sometimes when people are having kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs it could make things feel lot worse i just wanted to check that hadnt been your experience \\s patient: no \\s therapist: okay okay appreciate from what youre saying youre really very worried about this mi5 conspiracy that thats cause of difficulties that youre having at moment i just wanted to check with you do you think it could

things might be relevant to you at moment \\s patient: no because im not ill \\s therapist: alright \\s patient: its them ive read books on this as well i dont government know about them to know that they do this to loads of people i dont know how they can get away with it i have done nothing wrong i dont know why theyre doing this to me \\s therapist: okay sure i think i can appreciate that i guess what im wondering whether you think theres anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for short time might be helpful do you think any of those things would help you at moment \\s patient: i dont know i mean i want to hear really because someone warmer tried to i dont want to worry about ive tried to talk to her about it she doesnt understand she doesnt really believe me i mean do you believe me \\s therapist: well i certainly believe that youre having really difficult time at moment i guess im not too sure about whats causing this im im less sure this due to mi5 what im wondering it perhaps youre not as well as you might be at moment i mean weve been through lot of questions what im thinking we need to try come up with way of supporting you through this someone drink cuz i know your mom i think shes waiting in waiting room

            "therapist: hey michelle how are you doing today \\s patient: umm i am kind of doing im feeling little bit stressed out \\s therapist: stressed \\s patient: yeah i feel like i have lot on my plate i have this test that i have to take for work \\s therapist: what kind of test \\s patient: its like an aptitude test it has like math problems on it like scenarios in order for me to move up to system manager position \\s therapist: now thats job that youve been interested in for while \\s patient: yes yes so ive been just feeling lot of anxiety about taking test then they actually scheduled for me to take test i want i just got really overwhelmed i started like i felt my heart was racing i felt like i wish my hands were shaking i just really couldnt concentrate on test even though night before me my friend that practice problems i knew all answers with no proper like i didnt miss any of questions \\s therapist: so you know material on this test pretty well \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: but feelings that physiological response to heart rate sweating that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in way of you completing it like you were unable to complete it \\s patient: no i wasnt able to complete it thankfully they gave me chance to come back i just told him i didnt feel well so they rescheduled so now im feeling lot of anxiety because im scared same thing gonna happe when i go back \\s therapist: so you werent you werent feeling great about taking test in first place \\s patient: today night before i felt like i know all answers but minute i walked into room all of sudden all these fears kind of took over \\s therapist: but did you know that was coming \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: you did okay \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so you had some anxiety in advance \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: or no you did okay \\s patient: i had some anxiety day before but when i reviewed it with my friend im like oh i know answers i thought that would kind of push it down but i think once i got there it all came back up to surface \\s therapist: erupt in that moment that prevented you what do you think leading to this \\s patient: well ive always kind of struggled with tests im like i can remember when i was in third grade i had to take this test because i was really struggling in math i had to pass this test in order to move to next grade i thought just like this test that i was ready for it i had tutor i felt really prepared for it then when i took it i failed i was held back i feel like you know that was so it was it was really embarrassing for me to be held back i felt like i dont want to say but i did feel like failure at time because i felt like i really didnt know this i dont know why i couldnt pass test \\s therapist: since that this was third grade \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: since that bad testing experience have you had trouble with tests since \\s patient: yes i always feel really anxious i mean im able to pass tests obviously because i graduated from college school went on to high school but its so hard for me because of this anxiety that i feel that even though i may think i know it i may still fail test anyway maybe like repeat of what happened \\s therapist: alright so in third third grade you had really bad testing experience as you move forward from there youve never really been thrilled about taking tests \\s patient: no \\s therapist: but youve been able to adapt youve been able to take them still like pass them \\s patient: yeah i mean sometimes i get an \\s therapist: so thats thats good right \\s patient: yeah i mean yeah it good yeah its good \\s therapist: but this particular test which not for scorches for work yeah this one this more of stumbling block for you \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: you have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such point of anxiety for you \\s patient: i think its just fact that its this promotion so its like same thing like if i fail im being held back i feel like its we live in that moment of being held back that that thats like fear that i have that um that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back \\s therapist: so it really that same feeling youve had in third grade thats coming up with this test \\s patient: yeah i mean i didnt put them together until now but yeah \\s therapist: other test you take in throughout rest of grade school in high school they didnt they didnt have that same value attached to them \\s patient: now because they didnt have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose basically \\s therapist: you could you could take them again or take course again or \\s patient: or i could take another test to raise grade if i didnt do good on that \\s therapist: so you have you maybe had more options in school \\s patient: yes was it fail you know pass or fail \\s therapist: right so its its pressure pressure of you need to get through this you dont have safety nets that you had in school \\s patient: yeah if i fail it then im not going to be able to get promotion i would have to wait just like i did not have to wait certain amount of time i think an ear before i could take it again \\s therapist: so this lot of pressure \\s patient: yeah it \\s therapist: so there any time limit to this test for work \\s patient: um no there isnt \\s therapist: theres no time \\s patient: no \\s therapist: how many it like like multiple choice \\s patient: yes it \\s therapist: okay you seem like like you said you said night before with your friend \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre really well prepared for it \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so i have few few thoughts about this one im wondering you know weve talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs so im curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating for you now with this with this test this work test \\s patient: that i could fail that if i fail i could end up being failure at all you know things that i try \\s therapist: something like i am failure or im bound to be failure im destined to be failure \\s patient: i would say like im destined to be \\s therapist: okay so destined to be failure so that so that potentially core belief right thats thats operating \\s patient: i mean thats what scares me thats thats exactly thought that im thinking when im about to take test if i dont pass that its just gonna have like this domino effect of failure \\s therapist: okay so it could be core belief but its also seems like youre still on that thought like as you get ready to take that test youre thinking im just destined to be failure \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre having what sounds like panic response to heart racing \\s patient: yeah my hands shaking \\s therapist: are you in room alone youre taking test \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: you are so no ones really seeing you have this i wouldnt want to call it panic attack yet we havent really gotten too far into it but it sounds like it has some panic like features \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: because its not its interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to items so okay so one thought i have you have you ever had panic attacks in past or anything like this third grade thing \\s patient: no not really i mean sometimes i get worked out when im about to take test okay but its only around test \\s therapist: what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases you have any other physiological symptoms would \\s patient: want to actually do take test \\s therapist: hmmm \\s patient: um i kind of try to work through it start trying to answer one question at time to get to last question \\s therapist: so one one possible strategy here we talked about adaptive response right so which that thought that you say to yourself that self talk i wonder if your doctor response couldnt be i can ride this out like you have no time to test \\s patient: yeah thats true \\s therapist: i mean panic responses only maintained for so long \\s patient: i could also choose like maybe questions that are no answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress \\s therapist: to get some in sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like answering those right you know youre closer to achieving your goal \\s patient: yes then i feel like i know at least i know that like dont validate feeling that i maybe i can pass this test \\s therapist: so more items you you answer correctly less anxious youre gonna feel because youre closer to end of \\s patient: yeah definitely because then i start to feel more calm because i know that i know these questions are definitely going to be right \\s therapist: so thats so thats one well thats cognitive behavioral strategy right like you can you can wait out panic i mean youre in room alone \\s patient: yeah thats true nobodys there nobodys gonna see me im kind of trying to get myself together \\s therapist: yeah now panic painful right you know panic symptoms are painful so what you could tell yourself this isnt pleasant but i can write out these symptoms because they only last so long \\s patient: probabiy i could use like self talk \\s therapist: exactly yeah because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know five minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes but you have no time limit \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on items as you mentioned you could get right kind of at same time be telling yourself i can ride this out \\s patient: yeah i mean ive done that in past so i can apply it to this test \\s therapist: so if thats worked for you that \\s patient: yes that has worked i passed \\s therapist: so thats thats certainly thats certainly one adaptive response to try writing another one could be that although it wouldnt be great to fail you can retake test in year right you could try it \\s patient: yeah thats true \\s therapist: i mean i know thats not what you want but but alternative kind of buying into that automatic thought we know thats not working right im im destin that was word right like im destined to be failure we know thats not working for you \\s patient: so even if i have to take test again in year then im not going to be failure because i still have chance to take it again its not like ill never be able to take this test again \\s therapist: yeah you just have you just have another years of study right of course you wouldnt have that promotion that time that would be an outcome i know you dont want but its not end of your career its not like something so drastic its important to you i can appreciate that but its not end of your career youre not going to be unemployed \\s patient: no no definitely not just thinking back relating it back to third grade even though i had to stay back i still managed to you know do well next year keep moving up it hasnt really in long run prevented me from doing anything that ive wanted to do \\s therapist: so thats great thats another adaptive response which youve survived this before \\s patient: yes i definitely have \\s therapist: so this one event i mean i had incident third grade with unpleasant experience but this one event you dont want that this kind of fashion while use your word your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but panic like symptoms fortunately your employer going to give you chance to retake try this again i met you know so you have i imagine you could you can write out these these symptoms i think you have other adaptive response which ive been successful this before \\s patient: yeah i mean definitely i feel lot better now because i just know that no matter what happens ive been here before i can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that im going to just fail together \\s therapist: oh its so good when you have to take test \\s patient: on next week \\s therapist: so lets schedule one more appointment right before that \\s patient: okay right \\s therapist: well well make sure that you have these adaptive responses down youre ready to go okay really will kind of focus on positive outcome right okay which just taking this test taking one item at time fighting through some of these physical symptoms youre having fighting through useful thoughts \\s patient: okay yeah i mean that sounds good that helped me prepare for test \\s therapist: great so michelle ill see you ill see you then work through it i really appreciate you coming in today",

we can discuss to help you find cadet program close fine were able to give you you know some goals to set to get you in program at that but lets look at you know back lets back up little bit to marijuana because you i know being in law enforcement you know marijuana being cop pretty much \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: you would have to what would you have to do \\s patient: let it go i have to let it go \\s therapist: so what we want to do while youre here you know we want to help you here develop treatment plan treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals we want to set some goals for you also what about your medical history tell me little bit about your medical history have you ever been in hospital has anything ever happened to broken bone \\s patient: i had surgery on my cybereason \\s therapist: what about in your family there any diseases in your family you want to know suffer for any illnesses ailments okay as far as medical attention there anyone

family member \\s patient: no \\s therapist: what we want to do what i want to do to help you with this verse one want to develop treatment plan to help you with marijuana use we want to be able to look at your support system you know whos in your life right now what are your friends that you smoke marijuana with what type of people are they would this be good fit for you but our whole goal to start you off with small steps so today youre using marijuana how many times day so you pretty much said you use it every day \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but how many times \\s patient: 34 times \\s therapist: when do you wake up what you do \\s patient: yeah its not my morning routine go ahead do it then usually around noon time ill do it again then towards five oclock ill do it again at nighttime in fargo theyll do again right \\s therapist: so one of maybe one of realistic goals youre okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe relationship see which of your friends right now today how many of them smoke \\s patient: about six seven \\s therapist: yeah so maybe realistic short term goal to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know then also your mom man either way she \\s patient: she told me before you fall into wrong crowd fall into something just she pretty much said that this if i keep this up gonna get me into something i dont want to get into right

friends are we also want to look at your your time right now so you mentioned earlier that you were working are you working today \\s patient: no \\s therapist: okay so maybe thats another thing realistic goal that we need to look at maybe help you pursue it as job maybe because idle time sometimes can trigger events you know where you begin to want to use marijuana then we can identify some of emotions that youre feeling lets go over that maybe briefly before you get before you smoke marijuana there feeling that you have that says hey you depress so we can look at depression see how we can treat that what else what are some of other feelings that you see \\s patient: so angry you know \\s therapist: what you think \\s patient: be bit boring but my girlfriend so its kind of start so

            "therapist: do you have on your presentation do you have so many like bullet points you want to cover like \\s patient: yeah okay like an outline sort of thing \\s therapist: okay would it help to time deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points \\s patient: we never thought about that \\s therapist: i dont know how many bullet points youd have in presentation maybe youd have 10 or 20 yeah depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review certain bullet point as youre trying to get it into your memory think about it you breathe in really deeply then as you continue on you just let out that breath really slowly \\s patient: like rhythm sort of huh yeah can you go do same thing \\s therapist: i thought about it that way im just thinking itd be some way to structure so you would you would get in so many breaths \\s patient: something i wouldnt forget yeah \\s therapist: yeah something that kind of becomes habit okay just make sure you keep your bullet points of length about few paragraphs yeah but just just few seconds each so you can get good deep breath or you could you know if you did have longer bullet point you could have obviously several breaths but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete yeah because i know that in that moment things are probably like you mentioned zoning out right it becomes very easy to lose your anchors \\s patient: yeah exactly just get really foggy almost dizzy \\s therapist: yeah so if you can remember you know for particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths that might be something you can really have one too yeah would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do okay whens next presentation in that class thats coming up \\s patient: next one i believe next friday \\s therapist: that next presentation you have like in all classes one \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay thats next friday mm hmm do you know where you are in order like for presenting \\s patient: um i think im actually third in this one \\s therapist: not first this ones how many minutes \\s patient: im like 15 or so \\s therapist: okay its little shorter than 20 minutes so you have about half hour maybe little more if theres time to switch out of kind of sitting there right potential time where you could be anxious yes but also potential time you could be reviewing notes your bullet points breathing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: saying to yourself thats so like kind of self talk that theyre not really paying attention to me anyway right right because that might help reduce that that anxiety yeah whats one thing you could say to yourself when youre up there \\s patient: i guess i could say that you know in general i do pretty well you know one bad grade as in going to war make me doesnt mean that i dont deserve to be here \\s therapist: okay so sort of self talk up there could be i deserve to be here \\s patient: maybe ive prepared enough you know that i know that ive prepared im good student okay \\s therapist: ive prepared enough im good student i deserve to be here \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that something that would be helpful to write down have as part of your notes that you can \\s patient: yeah i think it would actually i can recite that \\s therapist: yeah internally as you because its not long \\s patient: i think i could it will be easy to remember i could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something \\s therapist: how much do you believe that those statements are true \\s patient: i think you know sitting now sitting here now i believe them in moment sometimes its little hard to believe because i convinced myself otherwise but i think i actually believe that that that thats true they deserve to be in program \\s therapist: okay so theres those self talk items you believe them to be true yeah but you recognize in moment i want you to be aware of this you might not believe them as much right but remember that you know we worked on them right you came up with them \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you believe them now right so try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself \\s patient: yeah its easy i realize its easy to form these plans right \\s therapist: then chaos of anxiety in words harder so more tasks you can make concrete you can write down you can rehearse i think better off youll be okay i would like to see you your presentations next friday yeah i would like to see you right before that so be about week okay for that do you have any questions these are items you can rehearse still even without presentation self talk write breathing of course preparing but you have any questions between now then you think \\s patient: i dont think so i think it makes sense yeah \\s therapist: understand kind of plan to attack that anxiety symptom \\s patient: i think you know what you kind of suggested before like maybe practicing my deep breathing like maybe now like when im calm getting into habit of deep breathing like im more apt to also remember it then \\s therapist: right so so good so you have some kind of behavioral pieces focus on studying breathing so cognitive pieces that self talk we talked about yeah that you use when youre seated use when youre at podium \\s patient: right \\s therapist: actually presenting alright good so im glad we have plan going forward i think that you did really good job today helping kind of untangle this figure out whats going on i appreciate that you were able to really connect with symptoms thoughts kind of realize how theyre related yeah i feel like this something thats going to serve you well as you move through this \\s patient: thank you \\s therapist: all right so ill see you in in week \\s patient: okay thanks \\s therapist: thanks hazel",
            "The therapist is helping the patient with a presentation by using bullet points to cover. The therapist requests the patient to take deep breaths, in some structure while reviewing the bullet points. The patient is trying to avoid zoning out or dizziness. The therapist suggests three deep breaths per bullet point. The patient has a presentation next Friday and they have half an hour before their turn to present. The patient plans to practice breathing during that time, give themselves a self talk that they are a good student and one bad grade doesn't mean they don't deserve to be there. The patient is asked to make a card to recite these. The therapist also acknowledges that these may not be easy in the actual situation and asks the patient to practice this continously since this can be practiced without the presentation. The therapist asks to rehearse and meet them before the presentation, in a week. The therapist asserts to the patient that they are attacking the anxiety symptom. "

            "therapist: hi kylie how are you doing today \\s patient: im doing all right not doing too bad how are you doing dr grande \\s therapist: not bad thanks for asking what brings you in \\s patient: um so my girlfriend saw your ad in paper she saw like out of some of things that you work on one of them smoking cessation it bothers her that i smoke um so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in talk to you so i figured i would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it \\s therapist: so you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you \\s patient: yeah i mean its just its easier for me like if i come in here talk to you like thats it i can spend like 45 minutes with you compared to ours or her nagging me through week so \\s therapist: so you weighed cost benefit decided to come in \\s patient: yeah i mean its covered by insurance its just 45 minutes of my time but \\s therapist: what she would like you to do this her goal not yours would be to stop smoking yeah tell me what your goal \\s patient: i dont really have one like i dont think smoking that bad well i mean smoking can be bad but like it doesnt its never bothered me like i i dont know its like i really dont have any goals to come in besides just having herself on you may \\s therapist: so do you have goal of quitting smoking \\s patient: no not at all now theres i dont know theres like so many good things about smoking i get one what really got me into it was i smoke lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with boss so like fact that i can get that time with my boss make worth it \\s therapist: can you tell us some of not so good things about smoking \\s patient: um i its just its how i meet people so like if i like ill have cigarettes on me but like i dont have lighter that kind of like keeps me from finishing off pack because i can finish off pack day but if i dont have lighter than like i carry cigarettes around with me then if i see other people are smoking i can go ask for lighter thats always kind of went away to get to these groups ive just met so many different people from from smoking like \\s therapist: so smoking way youre presenting it theres been positive thing in your life \\s patient: yeah i mean like i only do it socially so thats yeah \\s therapist: are there any negative aspects to smoking \\s patient: i mean yeah i mean everyone everyone knows smoking unhealthy but like i dont i dont smoke lot like i only only smoke from time to time its mostly just on weekends so its like i dont know occasionally i go by smoker for weekends i might have like cough maybe i get like heavy cough on mondays tuesdays part of me gone by wednesday so its not really that big of deal \\s therapist: so you dont seem like youre too worried about negative aspects \\s patient: now i mean like obviously unhealthy but like one of things im trying to do in my life now get out there meet new people like benefit of being able to do that smoking better than like giving it up for health reasons i think \\s therapist: so i wanna ask you question i want you to give response between one 10 as called scaling its to do with importance of stopping smoking so one would be its not important to 10 would be its extremely important to you where do you think youd put that number \\s patient: i dont know maybe like like two like itd be cool to get rid of cough on mondays but that getting rid of that not worth everything else i get from smoking \\s therapist: so not particularly important \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: now let me ask you same question except instead of importance how confident are you about confidence how confident are you that you could quit smoking on scale of one sound one being not confident all 10 being extremely confident \\s patient: i could say probably like an eight or nine like i could i could give it up actually i gave it up recently like for like month i didnt even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like i missed that so i just started off again but i dont know if i like if i really wanted to give it up forget im sure i could \\s therapist: so stopping smoking not important to you but youre fairly confident you could if you decided to quit so based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesnt seem like youre interested in stopping smoking what would be goal how could we spend this time so that it would be productive \\s patient: i dont know like i guess it would it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend that like stuff that i get from smoking like you you seem you kind of seem like you get it so like i dont know maybe figure out ways to like explain to her things that i get from smoking to like i dont know just kind of help her like realize why i do it other than just to kill myself \\s therapist: so to help her to understand why smoking works for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: thats thats one goal than any other goals you could think of i mean you came in in part because youre well that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so any other relational goals you might want to work on there \\s patient: well no we havent really been like weve been fighting lot because of smoking so i think like maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in way like i dont ascribe that but like having fights that are productive like that just dont always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving house but like i guess being able to like wrap up fight so it doesnt last for like days \\s therapist: so productive communication productive arguments \\s patient: right yeah yeah \\s therapist: so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly advantages of smoking to your girlfriend \\s patient: right \\s therapist: she understands how important it to you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: because it does seem like its really important to you but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument feel like youre not at stalemate \\s patient: right yeah yeah i think thatd be cool \\s therapist: all right well you want to make those two goals we work one so we can spend this time going up too fast \\s patient: yeah i can do it that its kind of like killing two birds with one stone \\s therapist: does that make sense to me well thats what well do so what id like to do ill see you again about week \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: so if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in relationship to be more effective communicator because lot of this revolves around communication \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: communicating advantages of smoking but also communicating in arguing so that you have productive end to these arguments right so its really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have positive result \\s patient: yeah yeah thatd be cool we can do that \\s therapist: okay so if you could work on kind of thinking that through then next time we meet well talk about those different goals maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals \\s patient: right all right sounds good \\s therapist: all right thanks for coming in kylie \\s patient: thank you",
            "smoking can be bad, but it doesn't it's never bothered me like I don't know. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss. I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me ."

therapist: little better even down for while whats going on \\s patient: i just feel like everythings gonna be okay \\s therapist: this unusual for you because usually when i come in you come in talk to me cut down or depressed something changed recently \\s patient: i just i feel like i found solution i just i know what im going to do so i dont im not really worried about my depression so i guess im feeling little bit better about it \\s therapist: can you tell me about solution you found for your question \\s patient: yeah i you know i know weve talked before i think that im gonna that i am gonna commit suicide \\s therapist: you want to commit suicide you know how youd do that \\s patient: yeah i have some pills in my house in medicine cabinet im going to take those \\s therapist: when do you plan on doing this \\s patient: probably couple days from now i have some things to get an order i want to you know arrange things make sure that you know everythings in order then then ill do it \\s therapist: what kind of things to to arrange \\s patient: um you know i want to make sure that all documents my husbands going to need that theyre in place that he can find them not going to tell him but i want you know i dont want to make things more difficult for him just that kind of thing you know what i mean like make sure that everythings in order so that when im gone everybody has what they need \\s therapist: so jill youve been seeing me for almost year now you know by telling me this that im gonna act to stop you but im gonna try to stop you from killing yourself \\s patient: mm hmm yeah i mean i want to do it i think in end its its whats going to make things better but i guess theres still part of me that doesnt want to die doesnt want to do that to my family so i guess im telling you because you know im not 100 resolved i guess i wanted to talk it over \\s therapist: you seem pretty serious though about your timetable in your plan \\s patient: yeah i mean you know its like when you plan to go on weekend trip youre pretty sure youre going to go but if weathers bad you might not so i think you know im pretty sure \\s therapist: there anything that can stop you \\s patient: um i dont know i dont i think i mean i feel pretty sure about it \\s therapist: do you feel like its depression or something else that drove you to this decision \\s patient: i feel like i feel like um its just you know same old things that i was worried about before you know depression you know my relational issues my job like stuff that that gets me down you know it just clicked it was like you know ive thought about it before but like i i feel like im gonna feel better i feel like its just gonna its gonna im gonna feel better so \\s therapist: as you said its solution \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i know weve weve talked about this issue in past right when youve come in feeling this way kind of resolved harming yourself we sent you over to hospital i know thats not your favorite place but when you go there for however long its been usually what five days come out feeling lot better \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: do you feel like this time would be different \\s patient: well i feel like in past you know ive ive been thinking about killing myself seriously but now im not as scared of it so i dont really want you to put me in hospital because then i wont be able to do it before i was scared so i wanted you to put me in hospital but now i just want to get it over with so i really dont want you to do that \\s therapist: so like i say part of you saying that you dont want me to stop you but yeah you came in here you told me so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure \\s patient: so like i say part of you saying that you dont want me to stop you but yeah you came in here you told me so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure \\s therapist: hasn it helped you gaining clarity \\s patient: i dont know i guess i guess i see that youre saying that like i really need to go to hospital i guess i was hoping little bit that you would be happy for me that i was feeling better but i think that you want me to go to hospital so i dont know it makes me think about whether its right decision you know \\s therapist: mean suicide \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: sometimes you know youve been with me like i said about almost year now youve been depressed much that time its not unusual when somebody thinks they found solution to depression even if that solution something that i am against like suicide that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain theres other things we can do have done past try to get you out of pain \\s patient: but we have done them in past i didnt feel better now i am feeling better so you know i i just want you to accept that \\s therapist: but im not going to its my obligation with it im happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive ive seen you this way before i know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from suicidal thoughts feelings you did well for weeks sometimes months at time youre seeing really just darkest when youre in \\s patient: yeah but im feeling better now \\s therapist: temporarily because you feel you found end to pain which i understand i mean understand you feeling better but youre feeling better because you plan on killing yourself weve talked about how devastating that would be to your family right your friends \\s patient: i am torturing them with my sadness im just making their lives miserable i dont understand how its gonna help them for me to stay alive you know im worth more they can have my life insurance you know i wont make them suffer anymore \\s therapist: so your logic that if you end your life youll freed them from having to deal with \\s patient: yeah feels like right thing to do \\s therapist: as you know i mean youve signed releases ive talked to your husband your parents theyve repeatedly said that despite sometimes challenge of dealing with depression they would much rather have you alive why would they say that \\s patient: i think that theyre scared of pain of losing me but i know that theyll feel better eventually \\s therapist: so theyll feel good over grief \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i understand \\s patient: i think that theyll understand that i needed this \\s therapist: you know ive been doing this for while right i think weve come to have good relationship \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i would hope that ive earned your trust you value my opinion well do something that i know about suicide you open to hearing it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: theres lot of ways that people die right its its really what eventually will happen to us all its hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide meaning when somebody dies of an illness or car accident or any other type of tragic accident people grieve right but theres usually not blame assigned to that mean they dont feel guilty does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: they feel sad because theyve lost person but they dont feel responsible for that persons death suicide different when somebody commits suicide their family friends feel responsible they have no answers to all questions that they have they could never get an answer \\s patient: im gonna write them note tell them everything tell them its not their fault because its not their fault i just want them to be happy without me \\s therapist: so you believe note will take away all that pain \\s patient: no but i think that it will help them realize that they shouldnt feel guilty like youre saying \\s therapist: itll mitigate that pain \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay i can tell you from experience that notes notes dont really help if anything its another artifact that they can agonize over i know its hard to see from your perspective because youre kind of resolved to this you feel stuck in pain you want now but they will miss you they will agonize for rest of their lives because theyve lost you its its special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someones death i know you dont want that \\s patient: i just dont know why you cant let me feel better \\s therapist: i know its frustrating i know its hard to understand times when youve gone to hospital before you have felt better your outlook was completely different not 100 but it was completely different when you came out i mean youre still little down but nowhere near depression wed want to hurt yourself it possible if you go to hospital this time you could come out feeling better again \\s patient: yeah its possible \\s therapist: im gonna make arrangements to get you out of hospital i know i know you dont weve had this conversation before right i realized that you know youre not happy with some of conditions there but you usually talk finally about groups right you usually do well in groups typically well every time right every time youve been in hospital youve come out feeling better i know its not what you want to hear i know you want me to be happy that youre gonna enjoy life but that would make me happy that would make anybody happy i know you think it would make you happy but i can tell you its not answer id like you to go voluntarily through this process will you do that \\s patient: ok lets go \\s therapist: all right ill go make those arrangements we can show you okay \\s patient: okay",

            "therapist: i saw thing that your name elizabeth im not sure if thats what you go by \\s patient: i mean liz would be best \\s therapist: all right great so this one of things i wanted to talk with you about i know that you did some assessments over last couple of days so i want to talk with you about that just talk with you about kind of treatment how things are going to go based on that sounds like what from what you were saying in terms of assessment process that you have an eating disorder its called bulimia nervosa im not sure if youve ever heard of that \\s patient: i mean little bit yeah okay \\s therapist: so what i want to do kind of describe that for you little bit so what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat like kind of large amount of food that you feel like that youve lost control you feel you know like overly full me vomit this happens fairly regularly there are times to when you you know youre maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight that feel familiar to you yeah so then it sounds like thats been going on for quite some time at least you know two three sometimes even upwards of five times week \\s patient: i id say yeah all right \\s therapist: so just want to let you know to about about that that its not unusual for person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this in fact we see upwards of 5 of women call on college campuses who struggle with that even more upwards of 20 who have you know kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting some may even like throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise so its not unusual one of things we know about blaming nervosa that for lot of women it really starts by excessive dieting so like going for long periods of time without eating sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively yeah \\s patient: especially when i was younger \\s therapist: one of things that we know about bulimia nervosa that when people overly restrict or you know stop eating lot or go for you know day half really restrict their calories that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle we know that thats case other thing that were aware of that lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have difficult time knowing what theyre feeling or managing feelings that something that youve experienced okay yeah all right well thats okay because in many respects i think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that so we know that theres lot of dieting restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings managing stress etc so one of things that i like to focus on in terms of working with clients working with individuals like yourself i take an approach its called interpersonal psychotherapy what that means in essence that i like to approach eating problem by looking at kind of kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context because theres lot of things that are probably going on or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times youve been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake so what id like to do really talk with you over next you know few sessions about you know periods of time in your life currently in past where youve had you know overeating episodes when youve restricted your calories when youve you know lost weight or when you you know binge things like that really start looking at you know patterns perhaps in your relationships then what well do kind of sum that up at end of time that were together see if we can kind of come up with little bit of game plan some goals to help you reduce your binge eating so hows that sound okay theres really good evidence for things you know things that were going to be doing in fact more that we work on some of these issues youll youll know pretty quickly that youre gonna start feeling lot better itll have you know pretty positive impact on your eating okay great so this what id like to do first of all first of all lets start with i want you to give me recent episode where like just recently within last couple days where youve had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like lot that you lost control that you ended up vomiting or you know it will kind of get an idea about that then what id like to do well go kind of back in time then i want you to tell me first time that you had an episode like that so then then what well do then over next couple of sessions then well well start from when it started kind of like work our way up to present ill just ask you lot of questions well you know kind of go from there right so why dont you tell me tell me like recent episode that where you felt like that youd lost control youre eating \\s patient: me like just this saturday night i guess i went out with my friends it was fun it was good night at first whatnot we then went to party i guess guess what kind of sparked it would be i saw sky that i kind of liked for little while i mean i just wasnt i was little nervous about kind of what i was wearing it just didnt feel that good to see him so i kind of left pretty early on went home or back to my apartment yeah i mean kind of what typically happens kitchen grabbing different foods bag of chips i think my roommate had left out like sleeve of cookies or something i just ate on couch yeah finished most of it yeah \\s therapist: okay did you been restricting your your food you know for prior to that or youve been dieting prior to that \\s patient: i mean i guess like dieting isnt what you would consider it as i try to eat more healthy typically yeah i mean ive been like dealing with different assignments stress around that so yeah its kind of fluctuated time okay okay \\s therapist: im meant to tell you to i like to take lot of notes at least initially so i have good sense of whats going on so what else was going on okay so it sounds like saturday night out with friends see person that you like that youve just say you dated some \\s patient: i really like weve kind of been like okay interested interesting yeah \\s therapist: okay all right im sorry okay so youre kind of interested yeah then you sounds like what you were then you began to feel more concerned about how you were how you looked at how your outfit felt yeah \\s patient: i mean i didnt plan on seeing him right now yeah yeah it just it was yeah right outfit to see \\s therapist: okay so that then then whats then what happened then that you go back to apartment foods there then you kind of sat down on couch you felt like that youd lost control \\s patient: yeah then i guess after that like before bed i made sure okay go into bathroom okay \\s therapist: okay its just kind of typical scenario \\s patient: yeah i mean yeah eating before okay \\s therapist: okay then um so you went home to apartment \\s patient: your junior year so my third year \\s therapist: in school what are you working on \\s patient: at english isnt major \\s therapist: yeah because i was thinking about time of year so coming up or any projects coming up so anything big on horizon for you \\s patient: i mean like midterm \\s therapist: okay okay okay \\s patient: ah yes studying for one of my midterms like on thursday night my test was on friday my roommate kind of has had her boyfriend over lot its pretty annoying because like she knew i had test to study for like i like being home to study i dont want to i dont want to be in library like i want to be in my room my bed theyre constantly in living room on couch yeah theyre pretty loud so its kind of frustrating yeah its pretty stressful okay \\s therapist: sounds like it um whats your roommates name \\s patient: kathy \\s therapist: kathy okay okay so then kathy has roommate over quite often this last week she was they were there quite bit boyfriend her boyfriend okay then youre trying to study did you talk with them about that in terms of noise or that bothering you \\s patient: i mean she knew i had midterm coming up okay okay \\s therapist: sounds like you feel like that youve tried to let her know in various ways that you know youve got something coming up that youd like to study when its quiet youd like to be able to focus but that sounds like that theyre kind of constant commotion really distressing to you right if you talk with her like one to one about how that bothers you or that thats real problem for you okay she know whats hard about doing that in terms of talking with her \\s patient: i mean were kind of like newer roommates each other we were introduced so we havent known each other \\s therapist: okay all right that makes sense okay \\s patient: i mean hes ever alive \\s therapist: okay okay okay all right okay thats helpful \\s patient: yes middle school so or eighth grade probably 12 or 13 \\s therapist: middle school 12 or 13 years old um good so well start from there tell me about your tell me about your parents \\s patient: so my mom lisa she my dad steve they actually got divorced when i was 10 okay so she then remarried soon after okay \\s therapist: okay so your mom dad divorced when you were 10 okay so alright so let me okay thats helpful then you say your mom got remarried \\s patient: two years after that okay okay \\s therapist: you havent any siblings \\s patient: i do now from this from her second marriage \\s therapist: okay all right that boy or little sister whats her name brooke okay so mom remarried whats your stepdad same bruce bruce okay okay all right so mom bruce they have little girl her name brooke okay how old brooke okay six oh shes six okay okay all right okay \\s patient: i mean like after or what led up to that \\s therapist: kind of do you have sense about what led up to divorce or what was going on \\s patient: i guess they were fighting lot yeah probably that those are probably my most memorable memories yeah thats fighting dad just they werent around each other as much anymore mom was kind of out of house more \\s therapist: okay then then so then they divorced when you were 10 so then how soon after did your mom marry bruce \\s patient: just under two years \\s therapist: under two years okay how was that for you to have her remarry so quickly \\s patient: i mean they really like it yeah okay \\s therapist: during during that period of time because i know you talked about middle school but during period of time when they were having difficulties with their marriage what was your you know your eating like or how are you managing that during that time in terms of your feelings about night ah \\s patient: i mean i guess i dont really recognize too many issues right then necessarily \\s therapist: were you talking to anybody or you know anybody reasonable did anybody else know what was going on or \\s patient: i mean i was like pretty close with my grandma my dads mom okay \\s therapist: she was aware of what was happening \\s patient: yeah she was yeah so she was definitely there okay im closer with my dad id say \\s therapist: okay even at that time sounds like that youre pretty close to youre pretty close to your dads mom \\s patient: yeah shes not around anymore but yeah \\s therapist: oh im sorry about that when did she pass away high school okay so alright so make note of that okay all right so yeah definitely make sure that we talk little bit about that okay so at 10 mom dad divorce less than two years your mamrie marys marys bruce so then what happened what happened to you after divorce did you were you with your dad with with you \\s patient: know with my mom more we moved to different area okay not too far from my dad i saw him like decent amount but definitely was with my mom more \\s therapist: okay so then you alright so then bruce your mom bruce in you because i know youre seeing more time with her moved to what like different different town different \\s patient: i just like town over okay but change schools whatnot \\s therapist: okay all right so prior to moving to new school were you in public school or private school \\s patient: isnt public school then switch to private \\s therapist: switch or private school okay okay all right okay how was that transition for you going from public school to private school \\s patient: i mean i wasnt excited about it it was kind of like more uppity area yeah i mean like it was kind of hard because theyre like like in private school these people have kind of been together for little while because theres less people there they kind of moreso all know each other have their groups whatnot \\s therapist: okay so then that would have been in around time when you were 1213 when you made that move okay so then sounds like to that that was time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating \\s patient: yeah i think i like started mate i felt like more pressure from my mom she was very vocal towards me about my eating my looks whatnot \\s therapist: oh that you felt when you say pressure from her in what way were she pressuring you \\s patient: i mean like she wanted me to look good \\s therapist: okay like what say that you would fit in more or okay okay okay doing \\s patient: hair yeah okay \\s therapist: it sounds like what you were saying was that well ask you how you felt you said you you said you werent excited you werent excited like i wasnt excited but so doesnt mean so did that mean that you werent sounds like if you werent happy \\s patient: happy let them know that i didnt like school \\s therapist: okay then what when you would do that what would be risk \\s patient: i just like oh you should feel lucky like its good school okay \\s therapist: okay well so many ways like one might be putting words your mouth but what like kind of get over it or like deal with it or okay so so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you werent really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasnt as much concern about your feelings about where you were was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like kind of get over it you know that \\s patient: i mean you mean in terms of schooler my body \\s therapist: no youre in terms of school \\s patient: i mean like get over it like it will get better with time like you just have to put yourself out there to meet people \\s therapist: okay all right so that kind of pressure yeah then you said that you didnt really like bruce what kind of person was man what was making you not like him so well \\s patient: i mean hes just kind of like sketchy guy okay \\s therapist: oh so that maybe that there was something going on between bruce your mom prior to divorce yeah sorry to hear that must have been really hard yeah were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time yeah okay like were you i mean how what was arrangement where youre spending time with him sometimes spending time with your mom \\s patient: yeah so i said my mom during week i got to my dad like every other week okay \\s therapist: okay so then given fact that in case you werent happy in school you said that it was more kind of an uppity school private school kids was it mixed school or was it like an all girls school yeah mix school that kind of clicky sounds like then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in little bit better so when in this process did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things like \\s patient: dieting its definitely i guess like eighth grade ninth grade that definitely came from like my mom thinking were telling me that to look certain way to knit yeah then there were times like like there was unhealthy food around hospital debris seats mm hmm there an accessible at times like i would eat that i would say for most part i would try to like really restrict myself to okay \\s therapist: okay do you recall first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as way to kind of like manage overeating \\s patient: i mean just like pressures of starting high school im in same school same people i really wasnt happy hard to make friends i dont know when i guess i heard from some of other girls about like vomiting as like an option right that theyve heard some of their friends talk about before right right yeah so okay like dieting even though if i was eating healthy i would still hear from my mom like oh like you need to look like this right heres this outfit i want you to wear but you cant wear it like if your bodys like that \\s therapist: so she was really critical of how you looked okay okay so then what was that what did that do let me take step back so it sounds like that youve always been little closer to your dad so then what was divorce move some of that transition what effect did that have on your relationship with your mom \\s patient: i mean i dont even really remember like really good time with my mom \\s therapist: okay okay all right so two of you dont get along as well okay did it was it getting was it kind of same during that time or was it getting worse \\s patient: i mean i guess i was getting more vocal towards her speaking my mind more \\s therapist: okay all right then she was then coming back more harshly more critically okay all right okay well its not unusual i mean couple things certainly not unusual for you know girls at that age you know in terms of like kind of social influence or kind of social contagion of you know with eating diet you know binge eating dieting vomiting so it sounds like that that was kind of in some respects part of that culture but it also sounds like that there you know in terms of external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look particular way it almost sounded like that that she was saying that you were like what you were too heavy for particular outfit so then im sure that that do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that \\s patient: today yeah i felt like nothing i could do right right yeah \\s therapist: all right cut of trump did you talk to anybody about that did you talk with your dad about that or \\s patient: its like no not really okay we have \\s therapist: okay so you kept lot of those feelings to yourself okay all right okay well thats thats thats helpful lets kind of lets kind of hang on to that because weve got couple things because obviously i think divorce move transition from middle school to high school also sounds though that also during that time that youre obviously you didnt have very good relationship with bruce to begin with that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating yeah then i know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in in high school but during that time like you know eighth or ninth grade did you have more contact with her were you able to like \\s patient: connect with her on that as much as i could she also i mean she didnt live in thats where i was living like when i would see my dad like occasionally we got \\s therapist: okay okay okay um \\s patient: i mean like i love were really close i love her but as well as training so as an only child then your mom gets remarried soon after new baby others also like my mom stepdad like they both worked lot so theres also like i was kind of looking after brooke got okay okay \\s therapist: okay so then right so not only did wheres your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating then all of sudden shes pregnant she delivers you have baby sister theyre working now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her but now youre also feeling pressure to take care of baby sister okay okay so during that time youre feeling what \\s patient: ah i just have you know lot of weight on my \\s therapist: okay emotional weight on your shoulders yeah yeah yeah then then what was your eat so then that would have been like you know years like 14 maybe to 16 when you were more active involved with that what was your eating like during that time \\s patient: i mean i guess kind of similar to like what i described kind of now i mean i like try to eat like super healthy right but then at times like especially because there was food available \\s therapist: so were you binge eating more during that time then \\s patient: yeah i mean because i kind of found other ways to make up for binge eating \\s therapist: okay all right such as throwing up so vomiting okay so then that that kind of began to that started during that particular time okay all right thats yeah okay thats really helpful to get that \\s patient: um i mean i guess i try to keep in touch with friends from my old school tough because they all have new friends ive met few people like nothing i know i really open to but i mean i have couple friends \\s therapist: okay um did anybody get anybody like emerges like like best friend or really good friend during that time or \\s patient: i mean i just went to my friends from like when i was really young \\s therapist: okay whats her name \\s patient: julia \\s therapist: julia okay so do you enjoy did you enjoy still kind of maintain contact during time yeah yeah did julia know what was going on with you are you did you ever talk with her about kind of like stress you were under \\s patient: like she knew i didnt like my stepdad that brooke being born right \\s therapist: so if she was one person that you could kind of confide in little bit did she know about your struggles youre having with your ex with your binge eating no likes \\s patient: okay yeah like we never really talked about it okay youre like she knew like my mom like put lot of pressure okay \\s therapist: all right okay thats helpful so so julia was then kind of source of support for you during that time also sounds like your grandmother was but then youd also mentioned early on that your grandmother died in high school okay so that when did she pass away okay when you were 16 okay what was that like for you when she died yes \\s patient: yeah i mean lot then like my mom for some reason didnt want me to go to funeral like i dont even know why um because she doesnt like me being like so connected to my dads family \\s therapist: im sorry about that \\s patient: yeah so there kind of like an argument there about going to funeral they had my dad get involved \\s therapist: so did you were you able to eventually go okay all right \\s patient: give me even more just been like fight with my mom \\s therapist: okay all right so during that time when you were arguing you notice more okay all right okay all right so okay thats helpful \\s patient: i mean that was well actually seen before that my mom bruce actually also got divorce \\s therapist: oh okay so alright so then \\s patient: as i got like 17 surprised like middle of senior year \\s therapist: okay so in middle of your senior year then your mom bruce get divorced okay all right so 17 mom first divorce okay what was that time like for you because then obviously then brooke then shes about two years old right no no no she before okay shes four years old okay okay so what was going on \\s patient: i mean i never really got close to bruce but i would say only hard part would have been like kind of figuring out with broke because i was really i mean i feel like i raised her yeah thats tough its just like frustrating that like my mom off my dad then get married then divorced dad \\s therapist: right yeah yeah yeah so then what did that do to your how did that impact

            "therapist: so were here today to talk about cbt your experiences of it how did you feel initially about thought of going for cbt \\s patient: my clinical psychologist has told me that i needed to see someone i thought i didnt need to see someone because there was nothing wrong with me i just had heart disease i my heart disease had got so severe i was just tired there was no one that could make it better by listening to me or talking to me only thing i thought that could heal me was heart surgery when he suggested that i see someone it didnt seem to make sense but because i was so depressed so far gone i my husband through my husband i thought i try just take chance just listen to someone or let someone listen to me because i wasnt sure what it entailed ive never been to clinical psychologist before so to me as clinical psychologist was shrink you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see clinical psychologist i didnt need to see one but when i did mita i realized that not being able to make up my mind by waiting for surgery for heart surgery im putting my name down on list i needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done because i didnt want to get surgery done she listened to me to way i felt what was making me whoa hold back on surgery what made me feel way i did funnily enough as woman you tend to feel that you can cry on someone elses shoulder but for first time just letting my emotions out to her she helped me cry by me speaking to her it helped me see myself from inside if that makes sense i then i began to understand why i had to get heart surgery done wasnt because i was tired but i had my family everyone that went through road with me of suffering was mad so i needed to get it done then eventually i did put my name down on list not knowing it would be done so quick because asked was just supposed to take me six to eight months to get heart surgery done but when i started seeing my clinical psychology i understood it i put my name down i got my surgery done in 30 days time so it sounds like part of clinical psychologists role with you to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not yes but you also said that you were quite depressed at time was cbt helpful for your depression as well it helped because then instead of crying holding things back emotionally it helped me let things out by letting things out it helped me understand what i was feeling because most of time we bottle things up we never let them out or we never talk to each other or other people so when we bottle stuff up it makes it harder for us to figure out ways to solve problems sometimes it can be little problem we turn it into big problem because we just dont communicate with other people or talk things over to make it easier to understand she helped me understand i saw her before surgery right through my heart surgery after heart surgery she helped me by then by time i started with heart surgery id lost myself confidence i was so depressed i was so withdrawn but after i had heart surgery i carried on seeing her she helped me gain my confidence back again she helped me gain my trust again she helped me see that there was something worth loving for again lot of times when i think of things that are needed for me it brings tears to my eyes makes my heart swell up because i didnt know another person could do that for you by just listening to you you know like when we go to mom when you got problem you think no one can understand but my mom can because she knows what im coming from but its not to say that clinical psychologists are like that but its just way they listen to you just having that someone that can listen to you just be there be still be quiet let you express yourself thats how help you find out what problems are that youve got help you solve those problems if they can \\s therapist: was there anything about cbt in particular that you found was helpful for you \\s patient: dr penny was there with me every step of way with all problems that i had she helped me show me that theres an easier way to solve everything not make big problem out of everything theres always someone every step of way that stayed to help if you need helping hand thats how i in by time id finished therapy with her i found out that clinical psychologists are not just strings they are people like us they do feel like us its so much easier to speak to someone when youre having problems because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later if you dont have to be mentally ill you can be in car accident any any problems in home something you can even have death in family that you can break down with you need somebody just to hear you how you feeling because we all assume that somebody else naturally knows what im feeling or thinking but its not that way we all have different \\s therapist: whether any drawbacks to going for cbt \\s patient: in beginning i didnt i didnt have any drawbacks going for cbt because i was so severely depressed i needed it i found that they were people all around that would help me so there was nothing only thing that was stopping me was me \\s therapist: sounds like it was good experience for us if you go any advice that you would want to offer anyone who thinking now about going for cbt \\s patient: yes dont look at word cbt but look at person behind it because sometimes we see big words we dont understand meaning of those words we assume but sometimes when we look behind word like clinical psychologists i would have said shrink i would never have thought myself going to one because they deal with mental people but its not that its you can have suffered from depression you can suffer from any kind of illness its so good to go to clinical psychologist when you need them because one sooner or later in our lives we will need one most people when you know like when you find younger people that nowadays lots of young people are going under so much stress in life if you havent got parent or friend youre suffering from depression those are right people to speak to because its good to be able to have someone in your life that you can talk to because i know theres no one in my family that i can talk to i always think my husband would never understand me my kids would never understand me when i go to doctor he never has that enough time for me but with clinical psychologist they make that time for you they listen to you youve got youve got that time with them to express yourself you still got follow ups they can check on you make sure everythings right if you not everythings not alright they can always check find ways means to help you get you in touch with other people that can help you or get in touch with other people that are in same having suffering from same conditions as you you can swap ideas with each other to find live happier life",
            "The patient share their experience with CBT. The patient was suffering from a heart disease and believed getting a heart surgery was the only way to heal themselves. The patient was feeling depressed. The patient visited a clinical psychologist and felt better also by letting emotions out to the psychologist which was bottled up all the while. After surgery too, the psychologist helped the patient to regain confidence back. The patient was assisted by Dr. Penny helping them to find easier way to solve things. The patient did not find their family members nor their doctor empathizing with them. On the other hand, clinical psychologists help us express and have follow up sessions. The patient says they also help to get in touch with the right people who had same sufferings as you and can swap ideas to find and live happier life. "

            "therapist: hi ann how are you doing today \\s patient: hi dr grande about same \\s therapist: about same \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what was going on \\s patient: well it might be little worse had you know ive been talking about my problems with perks past couple of times ive seen you i dont know i think at work they might be starting to notice little bit \\s therapist: they might be starting to notice that youre under influence of percocet \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: could before i remember when we talked it seemed like you felt safe in that no one was gonna find you out \\s patient: well yeah because when i take them i feel normal like it makes me feel like i can function i feel normal but like definitely last week my coworker in cubicle across way was she was looking at me she was just looking at me really funny then also ive been having little bit of trouble with numbers im just not im not on my game way i used to be i know that there connection to drugs \\s therapist: so in terms of concentrating focusing \\s patient: yeah yeah definitely its hard to focus but if i dont do it i dont know i mean i can barely get out of bed i can i dont know im completely what to do \\s therapist: this tough for you percocet makes you feel normal i would talk about this before yeah it used to give you high but not anymore \\s patient: no right it not fun \\s therapist: but it makes you feel normal \\s patient: right \\s therapist: weve talked about detox options \\s patient: oh god nono no no \\s therapist: its not something that you want so really whats changed to make things more difficult that youre worried that your coworkers are on to you right its your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that right \\s patient: yeah when you put it that way shes definitely noticed it she talks to so its not like shes if she thinks somethings up with me shes going to keep it to herself so that would be reputation piece then also quality of my work i know its its not same its lot harder for me to produce what i used to \\s therapist: youre afraid thats going to be noticed as well \\s patient: yeah for sure but i cant take detox theres its just not an option \\s therapist: alright lets talk about i want to do some scaling work i want to talk about importance of this change to you know cuz weve been talking about this change for while \\s patient: that change like giving up percocet \\s therapist: yeah lets talk about lets just talk about importance of it though so just focus on that one narrow piece okay were just were just talking about how important it so on scale of one to 10 with one being not important at all 10 being extremely important how important it to you that you that you can make this change can you make this change \\s patient: see i go back forth i dont know that its that important well if i lose my job that would be horrible so maybe it pretty important i mean its important that i keep my job its really important that i keep my job then it keeps my reputation \\s therapist: well so its important that you keep your job that importance in sense now appears to be tied to importance of not using percocet theyve been tied together little bit right \\s patient: yeah because to get out of bed yeah okay \\s therapist: so if you if you if you had to pick number one to 10 or 10 extremely important how important it to you to make change \\s patient: 7 8 7 \\s therapist: 7 so fairly important \\s patient: alright eight i mean i got to keep it up \\s therapist: you have to keep it up \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so lets talk about another construct thats important \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: i want to talk about confidence so using that same scale how confident are you that you can beat percocet \\s patient: thats what ive been trying to do for how long have i been coming in here \\s therapist: about about six months now \\s patient: ive tried i mean i have really tried i know i cant i dont i dont i dont think i can do it \\s therapist: so it was in one to 10 scale what do you think you would be \\s patient: like 0 1 i cant ive been trying \\s therapist: so very low confidence nope really no confidence you have no confidence you have no confidence that you can change its very important to you that you do change so this real bind trend \\s patient: yeah its pretty depressing \\s therapist: you mentioned that one of reasons your confidence low because you tried over last six months working with me youve not been successful at stopping percocet use \\s patient: ill leave here swearing to myself im done you know that next week im going to come in im going to tell you that i didnt use at all then like before im in bed ive already taken some you know that night \\s therapist: so its easy to see where low confidence rating comes in based on your experiences last six months how about other times when youve been able to make tough change if you look through your your past different experiences has there been any other occasions where you have been successful beating something like this making tough change \\s patient: well yeah i mean i used to i used to with gambling i guess i i used to hit delaware park you know on regular basis spent lot of money my husband was pretty upset about it i had really hard time stopping that \\s therapist: so that was those tough that was would you say that you felt addicted to gambling \\s patient: we oh yeah definitely \\s therapist: it was painful to stop are you happy that you did stop \\s patient: oh god i would never want to go back to that yeah \\s therapist: so when you were in middle of that addiction of gambling right how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then \\s patient: yeah thats thats really good point i didnt think that i was going to be able to say probably about to two or three \\s therapist: so theres some parallels here between what happened with gambling with whats happening now percocet \\s patient: i didnt think about it that way so i really didnt think i could do it then its been you know couple years since ive even been in casino \\s therapist: so you would say you were successful at beating that addiction \\s patient: yeah definitely \\s therapist: definitely success so what happened \\s patient: its so different its different its so different oh my god lets talk about that just like i just find myself popping them in my mouth you know \\s therapist: so mechanism different like for gambling youd have to drive to casino to drive delaware park \\s patient: right \\s therapist: youd have to have money \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: whereas percocets so easy yeah that you get them for my friends \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: its lot easier to consume percocet than to get in your car make time so mechanism different \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: but wonder if theres any similarities with this well with success potential success meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling you think that you could never get through detox \\s patient: i didnt think about detox but youre right it was miserable in that period when i first stopped kind of casino i felt that really strong urge to go i made it through that my husband was amazing \\s therapist: you husband was supportive \\s patient: oh yeah he was really great he would sit with me he would talk me through it we go to movies sweet you now he was really encouraging probably be really happy to see me stop using these percocet too \\s therapist: so as you reflect on your confidence this not something you necessarily need to do right now its probably important to consider that you were successful before in past all circumstances were different \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: but you gained too high from that gambling \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that was it was addictive \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you beat it it it was hard it was challenging but you also have supportive husband would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop percocet \\s patient: oh yeah yeah he hes really you know upset by way im taking them hes really worried about me losing job i dont see why he wouldnt be able to help me in same way i guess \\s therapist: well since this since stopping important to you but your confidence low but this might be good area to kind of process which you know you do have supports in place you have successfully defeated addiction before so its something to consider as you weigh you know i know that detox something youve expressed really clearly that youre not big fan of i can appreciate your reasons at same time get support you dont lose your job so lets do this lets between now when i see you next maybe reflect on some of strengths supports past successes youve had \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: see if we can accurately factor those into this equation right as youre processing through considering very tough decision so it makes sense \\s patient: i can definitely do that yeah \\s therapist: so well pick up next week there i really appreciate you coming in today \\s patient: thanks lot \\s therapist: thanks you",

to do to make sure their child taken care of \\s therapist: youre little worried through this was last experience youre talking about that you didnt rise level of good mom \\s patient: yeah i felt like i wasnt being good mom because i was preoccupied making work bit of bigger priority than taking care of my kid \\s therapist: okay so so good moms more about more than just rather your behavior right what youre doing about what youre also thinking so you took care of your child \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but your mind your thoughts are somewhere else some of time thats where you feel like youve youve wandered out of good mom area okay ive been on other side how about good employee did you mention that you want to be good employee \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: whats whats that look like \\s patient: um well somebody that you know takes care of all of their workload handles all of tasks that they have each day someone thats consistent reliable you know puts effort into what theyre doing gets their job done really you know reliably \\s therapist: thats where you feel like with sort of last workdays you missed you missed three okay how about last year how many days have you missed \\s patient: well i missed lot for maternity leave \\s therapist: so thats understandable but excluding that \\s patient: ive missed out since school year started ive missed if you include three ive missed nine days but some of those were half days they add up to nine days \\s therapist: okay total nine \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre allowed \\s patient: 10 per school year its only january im already at nine \\s therapist: i can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over 10 \\s patient: i dont know i mean i think that they would dock my pay for for those for it if i was there day i didnt have any more sick days left they would just dock my pay for that day but outside of that i dont know what else would happen \\s therapist: anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to hr department \\s patient: yeah i guess i could contact hr department \\s therapist: im just thinking because youre just one day away from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them see see you know what to expect right so this whole thing though missing days caused you anxiety frustration \\s patient: yeah little bit \\s therapist: about any type of feeling down at all \\s patient: little bit sometimes when i start feeling like im bad mom \\s therapist: okay so that so as far as your child concerned in your relationship with your child yes some anxiety relationship at work some anxiety but sadness mostly surrounds how you feel youre treating your job of all emotions of frustration anxiety what ill refer to as depression i should say sadness whats bothering you most what emotional response probably most \\s patient: probably sort of guilt feelings of not being able to be best mom \\s therapist: how would you rate yourself right now as mother if say 10 was best mother you could imagine right one was absolute worst \\s patient: im probably like an eight \\s therapist: okay thats pretty good right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what would be cutoff to where whats cutoff score that will scale i just gave it for good mother not good mother \\s patient: i guess like halfway like \\s therapist: so five good enough \\s patient: yeah feel like its not good enough for me \\s therapist: okay okay \\s patient: i wouldnt be okay with that \\s therapist: so if you look at somebody else another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable right \\s patient: probably yeah \\s therapist: but how about for you specifically \\s patient: yeah thats not \\s therapist: thats not gonna cut it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well weve cut it \\s patient: i dont know at least seven \\s therapist: youre an eight \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: sure \\s patient: no \\s therapist: not sure okay so youre close to border like youre close to border on youre your value system of being not good mother \\s patient: yes not as good mother as i want to be \\s therapist: okay now what do you want to be \\s patient: yeah i want to be like eight or higher \\s therapist: eight or higher where you are in s you said \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so you want to be parent sounds like \\s patient: well yeah doesnt everybody want to be best at what they do \\s therapist: i mean i think people are driven to to do their best but it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be 10 \\s patient: no theres some leeway i guess you have to allow for that \\s therapist: remember before in other sessions for situations youve brought in here weve talked about dysfunctional thinking irrational thinking how does reflect on that like usefulness of of these thoughts you know other mothers can be five b thats thats good right you need to be an eight or hire nine or 10 does it seem useful like useful way of thinking \\s patient: in some ways its useful because it keeps me keeps me on track if that makes sense it keeps me pushing to keep doing best i can \\s therapist: okay so it does have useful side does have an unusual side less than useful \\s patient: well yeah i guess it does in sense that if i become too worried about it then im wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom \\s therapist: yeah so i guess one things im getting at here has to worry has anxiety or it paid off for you \\s patient: probably not \\s therapist: why not so youre suffering with it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: it might make you little more vigilant but mostly most its just causing suffering \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so at heart of it youre not bad mom right youre in good mom category youre good employee right but your your way of dying yourself your perception that youre not doing great job at either one \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: thats thinking im getting that its not you know its not necessarily irrational im thinking its just less than useful its dysfunctional \\s patient: yeah i can see that \\s therapist: yeah were talking about that third day right third day of work you had to you had to call off do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that what was that morning when you figured it out like friday morning \\s patient: yeah um no it was really night but um well you know i went as far as to think am i gonna get fired you know i had to kind of think about \\s therapist: so your thought was am i gonna get fired \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: then what was feeling that that came right after that \\s patient: panic worry oh yeah \\s therapist: maybe some anxiety \\s patient: some anxiety yeah \\s therapist: were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time like did you tell yourself anything or did you take some action \\s patient: oh i did tell myself that i didnt go over yet you know hopefully i wont you know theres still chance that im not going to go over on my days hopefully wont go so far as to fire me you know \\s therapist: how did you feel after you consciously had that thought \\s patient: little bit better but still kept hovering around yeah \\s therapist: whole time probably all way till monday right when you returned to work \\s patient: yeah yeah like i wanted to call somebody at work talk to them about it make sure it was okay but you know it was weekend so i couldnt do any of those things i just had to wait it out yeah \\s therapist: so weve talked before about self talk you might remember me saying phrase adaptive response right so its kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that weve identified not so useful \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so degree those thoughts like am i going to get fired all that not very useful in that moment \\s patient: yes not useful in that moment \\s therapist: understandable right but not useful \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so whats you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that like specifically im gonna lose my job \\s patient: well i guess i could say you know i didnt you know im not i havent had any conversations with anybody that have indicated that so sort of like maybe i just need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when i come to it kind of thing like hopefully it wont i dont know if it will happen or not hopefully it wont happen \\s therapist: so so there self talk there theres no clear indication thats gonna happen \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so why borrow worry right how about other habit adaptive behaviors we talked about importance of support systems before other sessions there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that \\s patient: yeah my mom can can sometimes i did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take day but she couldnt because of what she had going on but in in other times she might be able to take day stay home or my sister can do that as well my husband can sometimes it depends on what going on that week for him at work so there are some options there \\s therapist: did you explore those options for this last time \\s patient: i did i did but just circumstances didnt work out \\s therapist: so none of those individuals were available \\s patient: right \\s therapist: there any other options you have for care was that it \\s patient: thats really it you know when shes sick thats really it because you dont i dont want to put her around any other kids which why i wouldnt send her to daycare so \\s therapist: that seems reasonable okay so there are some things youve already done right i think at this point since to address i know this lesser of your worries which your employer youre more worried about being good mom but to go look at employer side first second you can talk to hr you can try to understand what consequences are for going over explained that doesnt appear to be your fault \\s patient: right \\s therapist: okay i dont know what you can do in terms of support maybe try to get better awareness of schedules when theyre available or convey nature of your problem to them customer support \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so that was one issue now if you highlight more prominently though good mother want to touch on that as well you did everything you had to do to care for your child \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: are you sure \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay hundred percent \\s patient: except for my my thinking i was maybe little not as present as i should have been \\s therapist: okay well get to that but your behavior behavior yeah you did everything good mom would do \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so it okay if youre doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that dont seem congruent with that you know distract you away from that \\s patient: i guess its not ideal but its okay \\s therapist: its not ideal so youd really rather be have ability to be really focused on whats going on your child to exclusion of whats going on other circumstances \\s patient: you know or at least be able to put my worry about other circumstances aside for time for that time period \\s therapist: so by addressing employer issue that might give you little relief one good mom ish all right so heres another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts i think that reflect on whether youre good mom or not youre really basing it on this idea that if im thinking about something other than my child im in wrong place in terms of being good mom are you only being distracted \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so that pushes you on one to 10 scale \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: more thoughts you have like that you think of it as like pushing you down toward five \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so when you have those thoughts whats an adaptive response or you know self talk what can you tell yourself in those moments \\s patient: that im doing them behaving doing behaviors that i need to do baby doesnt know what im thinking so probably not she doesnt know what im distracted or worried so im not doing any harm to her \\s therapist: who doesnt know youre distracted or worried \\s patient: i guess just me \\s therapist: just you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so self talk that would be im doing what i have to do to be good mom thats what my child says right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but i have these understandable thoughts that come in where i worry about other things more or less justice what it right i mean youre permitted to worry about things life isnt going to be worryfree \\s patient: true \\s therapist: but we can we can work to not suffer more than we have to \\s patient: right \\s therapist: that kind of makes sense \\s patient: yeah it makes sense you know when you say it back to me things that im saying it does sound little bit irrational or unhelpful less than useful \\s therapist: yeah its little less than useful its not you know i want this important distinction its not good or bad right those words have function right in our in our lives but theyre little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when theyre applied to things like you know good mom bad mom \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but doesnt leave lot of gray area to talk about improvement right also it seems like what youre describing your your way into good mom category anyway sure 8 or 10 i think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10 \\s patient: true \\s therapist: so its not like youve drifted down toward five before somewhere okay so theres couple different yeah i know we talked about two different subjects right but theyre related work situation situation care for child but those are some self talk strategies so id like you to do when you go home today i would i would ask you to do it today if you can okay i think its important in states in terms of time near when were having this conversation if you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts remember i gave you worksheet before then work on some of your own calm adaptive response \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well it doesnt its okay if you have other problems youd want to apply model to but certainly around this issue of childcare versus work performance thats real struggle thats going on right now inside of you that right \\s patient: yes yes \\s therapist: do you think youd be able to have that completed next week \\s patient: yeah i think i can handle that yeah \\s therapist: okay so well leave it there ill see you next week \\s patient: okay thank you \\s therapist: thanks maam",

            "therapist: except that when youre in work you worry lot about how you come across in social situations \\s patient: yeah really makes me feel really anxious like what i look like what people are thinking \\s therapist: yeah you said that you worry that you visibly shake \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: are there any other things that you worry that people will notice \\s patient: i think obviously shaking i think my hands legs shaking kind of going really red sweating just looking great went ahead \\s therapist: so it sounds like you have quite strong mental image of how you see yourself when youre in these social situations yeah you say you go read you shake there anything else that you think that you do i mean describe yourself how do you think you look when youre in these situations just \\s patient: like i think i just looked really obviously weird out of place like really read just visibly shaking sweating kind of not being able to communicate properly with people \\s therapist: there anything that you do to try kind of defend against these things to manage these problems \\s patient: i guess like when im holding camera i just grip onto it really really tight or kind of clench on my muscles just find something that i can focus on to kind of try make myself shake less not goes red stuff \\s therapist: so you focus on something you grip onto that camera do you make eye contact with people \\s patient: no i just tend to just look down \\s therapist: okay so you also avoid eye contact there anything else that you do to manage sweating for example \\s patient: i just as i like kind of looking down like wearing all black so its less obvious what kind of worrying yeah just more layers all black says you just cant tell \\s therapist: okay \\s therapist: what do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things if you stopped gripping onto camera or you know you start to make eye contact not looking down what do you think would happen \\s patient: i think it would be so much worse yeah i think i just would just check even more be more anxious look of more obviously kind of weird out of place \\s therapist: what im thinking now how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things if we did bit of role play where we pretended to enact situation at work okay if we did this maybe twice first time you do all things that you normally do okay grip onto something look down there anything else that you do when youre in these situations these work conversations to try cope \\s patient: i just kind of all just like fumble like kind of just clench whatever whatever it im holding just really tight just make sure i dont make any eye contact at all just kind of get through it \\s therapist: okay so in first time i want you to do those things as much as you normally would in fact maybe even slightly more than you normally would \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: then second time i want you to drop doing those things all together \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: does that sound okay \\s patient: try my best \\s therapist: do you how would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: do you have camera with you that we can video on \\s patient: yeah there my phone okay \\s

behavioral experiments see what happens when you change way that youre behaving \\s patient: right okay \\s therapist: so first column says i need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have so that our experiment going to be that we do conversation at work who should i play if youre playing yourself in this roleplay who should i be \\s patient: maybe like client at work i always have to sit down with clients before we did shoe kind of get to know little bit more about what they want \\s therapist: okay so would it work if i was maybe having wedding i was hiring \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: wedding photographer \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have like what we see yourself doing on camera \\s

at all how visibly shaking will you be \\s patient: 90 \\s therapist: okay so what was other thing that you just said \\s patient: like i really read \\s therapist: okay so go read \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how read will you go i mean if we look around this room \\s patient: probably like chairs \\s therapist: okay thanks hello yeah youre going to be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs oh yeah okay so out of 100 then how how pink would you say these chairs are \\s patient: 90 have 100 okay \\s therapist: what else you worried going to happen when we have these conversations

to see that im sweating okay \\s therapist: how much will you be sweating \\s patient: again 90 \\s therapist: i really think like visibly sweating down face yeah \\s therapist: okay what you think will happen second time around when you stop kind of doing things you normally do to cope when you maybe start to make eye contact youre not gripping on something \\s patient: i think it will be even worse i think oh yeah \\s therapist: how much worse slightly worse like twice as bad \\s patient: twice as bad okay yeah \\s therapist: okay \\s therapist: right can you give me your phone number \\s patient: oh yeah should i just use this \\s therapist: yeah yeah its probably best okay \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: okay so \\s therapist: i was just wondering if i could talk to you about maybe

lot of natural shots you know talking when theyre having drinks \\s patient: yeah do you want it like do you kind of see it being outside that something that youre interested in \\s therapist: yeah shots theres going to be summer wedding so we like i like lot of outdoors shots if possible you know if its not raining that would be quite nice yeah quite some arty ones if thats possible \\s patient: yeah yeah thatll be ive done quite few things like that before \\s therapist: so have you got anything that you could show me about your past work \\s patient: yeah i recently did some shoots

its kind of lot of things i do are outside im really interested in getting natural shots so when i could change some of my work we could kind of see if we could kind of develop something from that could be quite good okay \\s therapist: lets pause it there okay ryans gonna give you this back now to look up okay i just want you to watch that okay then well chat about it in moment okay \\s patient: thats weird thing \\s therapist: so if we just go back to things that you predicted then you said that you thought you were going to shake visibly shake could you see yourself shaking on video \\s patient: definitely not as much as i thought i think its obvious that im obviously quite anxious but i dont think you can tell them shaking that much \\s therapist: so you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100 how much shaking would you say that you saw there \\s patient: maybe like less than 30 \\s therapist: okay you said that you were going to go red or pink as pink as these chairs 90 out of 100 did you notice yourself going pink \\s patient: not really actually definitely less than i thought yeah \\s patient: not as much \\s therapist: okay you said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid you know at 90 out of 100 did you know yourself say anything stupid \\s patient: not really yeah yeah thought was gonna be lot worse than \\s therapist: actually it was so you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90 stupid thats really quite strong i mean in end did you pick up in anything that could be maybe put that as zero \\s patient: maybe like less than 10 maybe \\s therapist: you said that you thought you were going to be sweating yeah that youre going to be visibly sweating did you did you notice yourself sweating in end \\s patient: not really definitely not as bad as i \\s therapist: thought again you thought you were going to be like night out like seriously visibly sweating so what what score would you actually give it in end \\s patient: maybe again less than 10 i dont think you could tell at all \\s therapist: mm hmm you also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what did you notice watching that video \\s patient: it was actually probably better when i wasnt doing any of those things i think i looked lot more natural i was able to say what i was trying to say i think it just come across more personable when im not kind of looking down stuff \\s therapist: okay thats all for now thank you so much for your time",
            "The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things. "

            "therapist: all right lets how are you \\s patient: good good \\s therapist: its good to see you yeah \\s patient: yeah i mean good week with roommates i had good conversation with her about like what times are good for boyfriend to be over kind of giving him better heads up on when im really mean \\s therapist: silence terrific so what was what specifically i mean i know weve talked lot about that but what specifically did you say to her or how did you bring it up \\s patient: just telling her that like my studies are really important i understand like its also important that she time with her boyfriend but that i would really appreciate that this both our space that there are times when like we really need to respect each others space yeah she responded really well yeah she was like just really give me good heads up before terrific you yeah that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have living room not \\s therapist: right right right because i think thats really similar no we kind of talked about that because i remember like few sessions ago i was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of ways that youve we talked about that before in terms of like you know first starting that oftentimes one of ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think youre letting people know what youre you know feeling but it doesnt really come out i know that its something that you i had to really like you know kind of work out but sounds like that you were able to talk with her in that she heard you as i want as i kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in very positive way \\s patient: so i think being little way direct was helpful \\s therapist: its really nice i think to youve been able to do that more with me i feel like that that i feel like its been really helpful i know theyve been kind of pushing you on that thats been hard but i feel like its been really nice to feel like its really been helpful with your relationship with kathy so thats fantastic also you know again i know that ive keep you know like saying this over over again but you know as youve worked on these things its been really notable that its really had nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like its really youve really seen lot of real nice improvements so awesome anything else that you know so you had really good conversation with kathy anything else go on this week yeah i got to spend some time with brooke \\s patient: at home for two days it was with my mom okay \\s therapist: okay so shes still sixers did she have birthday recently \\s patient: hes awesome \\s therapist: oh thats great almost seven great you plans for birthday for her or what are you \\s patient: she really into frozen \\s therapist: okay like anything frozen okay okay okay yes okay that sounds terrific so then you spend some time with her so obviously that was real positive for you did you when you were there did you have any opportunity to you know visit with your mom or how did that go i \\s patient: i think my mom was around like we kind of all spent time together like she asked about school they were like tell her little more about school how things are going yeah we dont really get one on one time \\s therapist: how does it feel for you in terms of like for her i know youve talked about not really liking that she all sudden deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like you know good mother kind of like be involved in your life but how it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you i mean \\s patient: ive kind of like allowed myself to tell her i guess i dont think have been going i mean like to an extent like it was like it broke whatnot like we dont really sit down just do together \\s therapist: so kind of what we had discussed kind of that youve been youve like youve been allowing yourself to be more connected with her but youre still kind of keeping up keeping little bit of boundary yeah yeah well im sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything thats gone on you know with you know kind of infidelity issue with your dad or at least its just you know kind of like wondering about that i mean i think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on but then you know then moving you how harsh critical she was issues with brooke you know even i still even remember to for her to have gotten to point where she wouldnt even let you like go to your grandmothers funeral or at least you know kind of so all those things have been so like you know front center you know so now i feel like that shes made this real dramatic shift you know wanting to start being mom that sounds like that youre really working to try to manage that in you know in better way \\s patient: yeah i mean like we still butt heads little bit im sure shane but \\s therapist: yeah yeah but when you do butt heads what it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that theres little bit of friction \\s patient: i mean i guess thats like kind of leaps back to things like things are really good this weekend for most part then kind of when i was leaving she just like either just brought up things about wanting to know more about life whatnot whats going on at school if im seeing anyone yeah its just like we dont have that relationship \\s therapist: right so that really thats really stressful time \\s patient: like when i got back to school like right after that like caught me \\s therapist: well it makes lot of sense because again you know like you know weve really reviewed this quite bit but you know historically thats how its been you know that thats really been real enemy it really clarifies why were working on this because its so clear that when two of you have like these rough patches that it really all of sudden evokes all these like negative feelings thats when food like really you know \\s patient: you know all comments though yeah what im wearing right right \\s therapist: right right yeah so its really hard to you know i can understand its really hard to let that go i mean cuz obviously theres lot of lot of feelings that you have about that yeah yeah but on other hand too it seems like that you know things have been going really well how have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships you know anything else thats on horizon \\s patient: yeah kind of scene guy \\s therapist: i wont get too excited about that but tell me about him telling you about him \\s patient: yeah he felt like my mother \\s therapist: now whats this you have to at least give me his name whats his name \\s patient: his names alan \\s therapist: alan okay okay all right well did you like im not gonna blow this out of proportion but how how did that kind of come about \\s patient: yeah cost together kind of went studied at coffee shop yeah then just kind of asked to like do movie night i was like chill good nice ya know like \\s therapist: yeah nice nice thats great oh im really happy thats great so lot of really nice things that are going on yeah thats terrific yeah so then for you to go like from you know because you know we kind of got going with this thing it was kind of like you were full on binge eating you know virtually every day sometimes twice day now itd be down to you know three like in space of like you know just like seven eight weeks pretty remarkable so no im really pleased with how hard youve been working cuz youve really been pushing yourself i really appreciate it i know this stuff with your mom particularly hard its hard for you \\s patient: like not being able to like i dont feel comfortable really telling her yet about \\s therapist: you may not you know i mean its like you know another we talked about theres like maybe there are times when you just dont really want to share some of that stuff you know i think sometimes my experience has been some parents like you know goal not to make her feel bad if you would want to share it youd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that keep it really connect with you around it want to be helpful rather than like like oh yeah you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder you know because then that that feels you know that doesnt feel quite right know that thats you know i know that you have lot of hard feelings but i dont really feel like that thats how youd want that to go you know yeah i know weve talked about it lot but how are things going with your dad yeah \\s patient: yeah yeah hes doing well hoping that hes coming up here to school to see me once he plays couple weeks great \\s therapist: so nice theyll be really nice for you to spend time with them thats great thats really great yeah so lets talk some more about this thing with your mom because i feel like that i mean i know its tough but i guess ive been thinking about this lot especially after last session that that given fact that you know you brooke are so close it does feel like that your mom at least she seems like shes making shes trying to make an attempt to connect with you whether or not you know at what point would you feel like that you well what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like maybe not let down walls but kind of soften those little bit i mean there something there something that like if you could ask theyre like okay mom if you did this then i would do this not that you would do that but just wondering if like what would you ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more \\s patient: i mean like i wish she really recognized like kind of pressures that she put on me back in day huh yeah just like now to just know just kind of be there in moment so like trying so hard to like things still come out like she still makes her little comments that they \\s therapist: yeah i know we talked about this but have you gotten to point yet where you felt like that you could like even let her know that that that puts lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because i know that in moment you feel it but what would it be like for you if you were to just like yeah say like you know i know that youre i know that you mean well i mean maybe she doesnt but maybe its sometimes important to approach it that way but it really hurts my feelings or you know i feel like that that really puts lot of pressure on me to look particular way you know \\s patient: so i mean i am seeing that i like starting to see that she does mean well \\s therapist: right because i know that you did that youve done that with your roommate i know theres been other times when people have done that so i know that thats been kind of part of bigger issue just knowing what it youre feeling also being able to kind of give voice to that you know thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in while she kind of like jabs here shell send something out way that you take it in more like harsh critical you know her i just dont know like color its kinda like with kathy when you talk with her how its like it was like it was like oh of course like you know uh you know ill try to be more sensitive im not really sure you know whether or not your mom would be \\s patient: yeah i mean i guess she could do yes i worry that because weve always been kind of defensive towards each other i just worry that like that will happen again i mean i dont know like it might not because of things happen right but \\s therapist: yeah yeah yeah well i think there are times when i wonder if like maybe if theres time when you say something like i know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her you know or youll kind of like you know barber or kind of jabber little bit what if you know again you what have you thought about like because it sounds like that youre really aware when you do that because you know that when she says something you have tendency to jet back you could just say you know you know i realized i was i that was that was jab at you im really sorry i aware that that sometimes i kind of get really critical with you i that doesnt i dont feel very good about that now i wonder how she would you know if if that would what that would do maybe maybe it wouldnt do anything or may make you feel little bit too vulnerable but you think about it i mean you kind of mull that over in your mind about what that might be like because my experience has been that sometimes you know i hate phrase be bigger person because then you know i didnt want that to come across that way but sometimes in order to change relationships somebody has to be willing to kind of like kind of be willing to do something just little different since it seems like you have growing awareness of you know interactions that you have with her i wonder if that might be worthwhile yeah yeah yeah mulling over think about it well keep talking about it but yeah sounds like it was really terrific week been working really hard it really pays off because again more youve done that weve seen real positive impact on your eating so nice",

            "therapist: so tommy i wanted to talk to you because i was on facebook other day saw some pictures from party you were at made me little bit concerned because i saw you were drinking i wonder if you can tell me little bit about how alcohol fits in your life \\s patient: i mainly just drink whenever im at parties or whenever somebody hands me beer ill ill take sips every now then but its not something that i feel hovers around my life \\s therapist: its kind of social thing for you not like major priority yeah how much do you think youre drinking \\s patient: i guess i would say like every other every other weekend maybe every every two weeks on occasion maybe theres basketball game going on or football game ill have beer just to drink with my boys but other than that i dont really see it as much of of problem \\s therapist: so youre drinking maybe half time depending on whats going on that weekend \\s patient: yeah i guess you can say that \\s therapist: well how would you describe difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you dont \\s patient: when im not drinking im usually more like involved in doing like more productive things like i i try do more schoolwork whenever i have time or whenever i like i can go workout or something just to like when whenever im drinking i devote my time to just letting loose having fun just relaxing with friends okay \\s therapist: so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when dont drink but maybe you dont feel like you can relax as well \\s patient: yeah i mean i whenever im drinking i know that im devoting time to to not doing other things so i try make it so that i dont allow myself to pile on so much work so i try like get work done before but i know that drinking gets in way of productivity so i try minimize that as much as possible \\s therapist: youre trying to be responsible get your stuff done yeah knowing that drinking gonna make it harder yeah okay it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink \\s patient: yeah i guess when i drink some things do slip little bit but just because like when im drinking im im not really focused on what i have to do im focused on moment just enjoying time that i have at that time its really something that i just its something of an like pleasure givers like enjoying joint enjoyment type of thing \\s therapist: what are things you enjoy about drinking \\s patient: just way that it its sort of like liberates you makes you it makes you feel like more confident more energetic person that you dont feel like yourself you feel like different version of yourself its something that you it its just empowering to degree \\s therapist: okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways yeah okay are there any not so good things about drinking \\s patient: um whenever i drink too much i sort of lose control of myself i i just like aftermath of whenever i drank too much or whenever my friends mixed drinks it just has harmful effect on my body thats probably one of major drawbacks that i had from drinking \\s therapist: what kinds of things happen \\s patient: i mainly when when i puke or its just feeling that i get in my stomach if i drink too much just very overwhelming \\s therapist: like you notice in your body how much do you think most youve ever drank in one time \\s patient: wow i would say probably \\s patient: at friend one of my friends had birthday party recently he wanted to let loose was it was just all guys were together they had couple of friends over it just turned into one big party i just i lost it i drank way too much i would say like probably bottle or two just some beers along way i got to point where i lost count \\s therapist: that was out of ordinary for you to discount whats more typical amount that you drink \\s patient: i dont let myself drink more than three or four beers on given night just because i know im ive gotten to point where i sort of know my limit but i kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far i can go i think that that sort of very dangerous to play with fire but i want to see how far i can go just so i know not to go that far \\s therapist: got it so youre youre sort of testing pushing it in yeah sometimes crossing that limit having some of consequences that you mentioned \\s patient: yeah just so i know how it feels now so that later on when this situation more drastic more out of control i know what i can do where am i limit it you \\s therapist: well kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as goal for yourself \\s patient: in terms of career wise in terms \\s therapist: of what do you think youll be doing in five years \\s patient: i would love to be \\s patient: i would love to travel i would love to see world for what it ive always seen pictures videos of how world but ive never really experienced that like ive always wanted to travel to europe or or china or something or someplace like that so i can really experience world \\s patient: that we live in \\s therapist: so getting full experience really important too it sounds like throughout your life you know you talked about wanting to make most of your high school experience now youre looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways how do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to its fullest \\s patient: i guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel effects of living life to fullest but i wouldnt want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because im i know ive seen consequences that drinking has on people i know that i would never want to get to degree where i need to drink constantly every single day i dont want to ever get to that point \\s therapist: okay so just to kind of summarize what youve told me so far youre youre drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe probably maximum that you can drink before youre having some of these negative consequences you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less \\s patient: yeah feel more in control \\s therapist: then kind of looking ahead you dont want to find yourself being someone whos drinking all time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that youve seen that maybe in other peoples lives its not appealing to at all you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with so where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking \\s patient: maybe now that i know my limits to an extent i kind of dont want to push it so so much now that i know what i can do where i can go i would like to mitigate that as much as possible i just want to i want to have fun being me but i dont want me to be influenced by alcohol so much like i want to live sober life to an extent but i know that alcohol just gonna tamper with it \\s therapist: so for right now it feels like reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking make sure youre youre stopping three for example or maybe even limiting number of times that youre drinking \\s patient: yeah like not like not drinking like in mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around like i dont want to have it like in my fridge if my parents have it i dont want to i dont want to have to deal with it \\s therapist: okay what do you see as some benefits to that \\s patient: benefits \\s therapist: sticking to those limits \\s patient: i guess i could definitely be i could live more fulfilled life to an extent like i could possibly be more productive more efficient in my work where i can possibly be in next few years of my life i think that by not drinking i will definitely have better effect on my life \\s therapist: yeah i think taking steps to limit cut back on your drinking really good idea i really appreciate you taking time to talk with me about it being open honest question you know if you dont mind i would like to talk to probably about this in couple weeks or couple months just kind of check in how things are going right all right sounds good \\s patient: thank you very much",

            "therapist: how are you doing today \\s patient: good \\s therapist: whats been going on \\s patient: been little anxious about shopping habit that i have \\s therapist: talk about that \\s patient: yes well i have to buy everything in pairs or in twos if i only have one thing i wont buy it ill put it back or ill look around store for another thing so that i have two things to buyy \\s therapist: so when you go into store if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy second item or even more just second \\s patient: sometimes it can be more as long as its reached minimum of two \\s therapist: so you have to leave having purchased minimum of two right or if you cant find something else you wont buy it at all exactly so so zero would also be acceptable \\s patient: zero would be acceptable \\s therapist: but one \\s patient: no no no i cant do just one guy cant do one okay now its got to be two or more \\s therapist: what happens that has ever been occasion where youve only purchased one thing \\s patient: i cant really remember one im sure there has been but i cant really remember one \\s therapist: so for all this period of time you have successfully either purchase nothing or two or more items \\s patient: oh yeah i have to its very anxiety producing if i dont know \\s therapist: how anxiety producing \\s patient: it i just feel like something bad will happen if i dont keep it to two or more \\s therapist: you know what would happen give specific \\s patient: well for example like my family would be in car accident or i would hit deer or you know get fired from my job \\s therapist: so something really really bad will happen this hurtful for you this causing you pain \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: this would happen this would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing youd be reminded so if you went in wanting more than one thing its not problem right \\s patient: its if i only really need one thing then i cant just buy that one thing that i need \\s therapist: alright so how often does this happen where you are in situation where you want to make purchase of just one item you have to you have to change because anxiety \\s patient: daily \\s therapist: daily \\s patient: yeah because i mean if i go grocery shopping or if i go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing you know which i would encounter daily pretty much it happens \\s therapist: i would like fill up your car gasoline \\s patient: oh then oh bipac accom \\s therapist: so it has an effect that level two \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so youre thinking it almost like number of transactions has to be more than one i mean it has to be two or zero \\s patient: yeah i guess so yeah no or vitamins or number of transactions yeah because see if i get gas then i have gas in my car thats thing \\s therapist: thats one transaction one thing one thing okay then okay so thats one product right you need another product right so you really cant feel your car without going inside station store \\s patient: no \\s therapist: so it doesnt matter that theres more than one gallon going in because its same product \\s patient: exactly yes \\s therapist: so i could see now this this would be more of daily thing you said right yeah because at first i was thinking daily thats lot of individual shopping trips but it applies to all transaction \\s patient: exactly yeah i did really realize that that way but it does yeah yeah \\s therapist: so this fairly significant source of anxiety for you \\s patient: yes it it does pr i get you know like builds up in me i feel it \\s therapist: so lets talk about that help me to understand this better so lets say that you went to convenience store just had one thing in mind what might be potential item that you would gum gum right so you want to go in you just want to buy pack of gum thats all you really want thats why you stopped at store \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so you go in you have any thoughts now we talked in past about automatic thoughts these thoughts just kind of come in right so are there any thoughts in there happening when youre walking into store \\s patient: yeah i start i start with what do i need why am i here you know i need pack of gum then its instant anxiety that what else am i gonna get what else can i get to make it two \\s therapist: all right so thought what else can i get yeah like this one past will be two has to be two it has to be two thats not thats yeah so thats also possible more demanding yeah so it has to be \\s patient: yeah so i guess first thought what else what else do i have to get yeah then so jumps right \\s therapist: to anxiety so anxiety \\s patient: it starts going down okay \\s therapist: so its really gradually \\s patient: yes but it really it really yes once it completely gone when im done that \\s therapist: alright so you so really worst anxiety would be approaching store entering in that moment of uncertainty when you dont know second yeah \\s patient: absolutely all right \\s therapist: okay so if you could relieve that anxiety that would be one of your goals \\s patient: that would be fantastic fantastic \\s therapist: all right so lets think about this way do you do you know reason that you do this you have any guesses \\s patient: i would guess that i mean weve talked about you my dad had some bad experiences i had i sound awful yeah theyve they were difficult so i wonder if thats not somehow linked to this behavior somehow being impossibly \\s therapist: alright so youve been through some really tough times to put it mildly what youre afraid of if you only buy one item something safety related happening \\s patient: yes yes like car accident or yes safety definitely my personal safety or my familys safety \\s therapist: i guess security like \\s patient: security yeah yeah security \\s therapist: so safety security theyre at risk for you \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: when you dont follow this role rule i will yeah so if we think about it in terms of cognitive model we talked about core beliefs intermediate beliefs which are attitudes assumptions expectations so core belief here only thoughts when it might be \\s patient: well now that you said that or you know pointed out those safety security issues i didnt really realize that but it maybe that just that im not okay im not \\s therapist: im not okay im not safe i am vulnerable \\s patient: vulnerable yeah im vulnerable am i an exposed exposed to danger to \\s therapist: sure at risk yeah \\s patient: thats my rule \\s therapist: then when situation presents itself which would be an impending transaction thats situation we talked about how situation blends together with that in this case rule that intermediate so when they come together whats that automatic thought \\s patient: when situation \\s therapist: trends potential transactions approaching you you handed me belief i need to buy everything \\s patient: in tears what else am i getting in \\s therapist: then whats behavior that product of that automatic thought of i do you buy second item yeah feeling feeling of falls \\s patient: that follows that purchase of \\s therapist: well follows on mac thought oh anxiety anxiety then whats feeling that follows purchase yeah relief relief alright so can you see how mechanism whats happening to you could be explained one explanation through through cognitive load \\s patient: there much it didnt sit very well \\s therapist: alright so lets talk about rule of rule of two now we we we talked before were talking about cognitive therapy about useful less than useful thoughts right functional less functional or dysfunctional thoughts do you think that sitting here now not so much necessarily in store i know thats probably different thought process but talking with me now do you see causal connection between purchasing two items safety or security breach \\s patient: yeah i mean theres no i recognize you recognize your work stuff that its not it doesnt make sense its not useful useful thought maybe \\s therapist: its not useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so you recognize that you appreciate that there not link between elio purchasing here in either direction though right meaning so you realize that that if you buy to this doesnt necessarily keep you safe either so you cant introduce safety or process of risk of being unsafe you cant introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior \\s patient: thats very true yeah \\s therapist: does that make sense \\s patient: yeah it does it really does i cant it doesnt make what youre saying makes sense but it doesnt make sense to introduce safety or either side of point \\s therapist: so do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but thats not what your mind telling you thats not what your thoughts are telling you thats logical you can sit here with me its not easy to say but you can say yeah i dont see link \\s patient: yeah i dont see link but i know what i feel what i feel that impending doom if you will \\s therapist: so lets talk about that moment so in this moment maybe little anxious now but you can kind of see how right you cant protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else by buying to or failing to buy to write in store or wherever you make transaction different story so you have lets lets go different direction i talked about how you walk into store you think well i get those phone right you end up getting something else yes anxiety then kind of goes away well come up next time that happens but its way its gone for that moment so i want you to kind of stay with me as i go through another scenario you maybe have figured out what im going to do here but \\s patient: i need it in your scenario okay \\s therapist: so maybe gm isnt ideal example but you see my right yeah see you go into now you go to store you realize you only have enough resources to make one transaction you really want it so zero not so now walk me through thoughts feelings \\s patient: what i would normally do or what i \\s therapist: would think would happen \\s patient: i would panic i mean not panic like break down or something but i mean it would be very very stressful if i absolutely had to get that item um i would probably try to scrape change out of my car but i know were not going there now yeah no stay there but um i would be very very difficult \\s therapist: could you do it \\s patient: im physically capable of doing it okay \\s therapist: that one level of being able but how about in terms of your thinking your feeling \\s patient: i could do it i could do it i could get through it \\s therapist: what would happen how much anxiety with you experience with anxiety fade off \\s patient: it will fade off i think i mean it would have to i would imagine so it would fade i think it would take longer period of time to fade than if i had just gotten even now seeing here but even if i had just gotten another item okay world going to be safe for another five minutes were good how much youre feeling right now very anxious right yeah \\s therapist: are you worried kind of anxiety where youre worried that something catastrophic gonna happen okay so even talking about transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety security \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so you can you can trigger that without transaction even pending \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: really scared sitting here \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: unbearable anxiety of mens embarrassment \\s patient: yes its bearable its bearable \\s therapist: but does it hurt stuff \\s patient: yeah its hurt me feel bad \\s therapist: what do you feel gonna happen with seeing xiety about \\s patient: your scenario of having to having to get only one item or having only having resources for one item \\s therapist: okay so its not safety security its its concern about going through buying one item on rule those two yeah yeah im talking about breaking rule \\s patient: i know its terrifying this this this skin for you \\s therapist: because so youre anxious about that youre also anxious about consequences of that \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so anxiety youre experiencing right now in this moment with me i want you to be mindful that guys keep that in your awareness let me know if that changes just interrupt me if you need to its not \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so it might get worse it might get better so there something on your mind that you need to buy within next couple of days \\s patient: yes coffee coffee \\s therapist: thats transaction of one \\s patient: yes so ill get something \\s therapist: okay right yeah understandable but what if what if i challenged you to behavioral experiment okay can you guess what that might be \\s patient: to buy one coffee in scenario two \\s therapist: to buy one to buy one cup of coffee then i dont know where to buy coffee but leave yeah wherever it leave so what are possible things that could happen knowing that logically you can connect it to safety thing you might be anxious about that thats real that anxiety real but knowing that event isnt prevented or caused by exactly transacting behavior lets go through what happens so you buy coffee youre really anxious right up to it youre anxious to go into driving there either \\s patient: i would have lot more anxiety but i would really have to talk myself through that \\s therapist: would it go away \\s patient: i believe it was anxiety i believe \\s therapist: so itd be more painful experience to buy one \\s patient: yes yeah \\s therapist: but it wouldnt actually harm you \\s patient: oh yeah no not at all \\s therapist: but it would cause you more internal anxiety \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: so what would happen if you did again \\s patient: i would hope that it would be less anxiety could be could be \\s therapist: repeated 100 times \\s patient: it could be i would get old i think anxiety would get exhausted \\s therapist: so really what youre doing youre conditioning youd be conditioning yourself right to to to surviving just buying one item i have lot more money financial advantages to it certainly thered be you know what i hope freedom advantage which freedom to buy any number of miners next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for coffee example i mean i asked one thing youre going to buy coffee but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this i dont know if coffee optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe i guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example gasoline because youd get your car by gasoline you leave yeah that would be easier for you you will be tempted by other i \\s patient: wouldnt have to walk through coal to store right or to door of \\s therapist: wood thatd be easy itd be you know might be \\s patient: that would be much easier okay \\s therapist: so we will we will consider that kind of step in direction that would result in fewer symptoms yeah that would be wonderful maybe another step in future if we get there so it goes with us but it would be to go into store buy one but lets not lets not do that okay lets stick with gasoline \\s patient: okay i feel more confident about that \\s therapist: you feel like you could succeed with that yeah experiment \\s patient: well see when we actually get there but yes i would like to i feel like i could actually try that more so than coffee so \\s therapist: are you afraid with coffee that you might just end up buying too okay \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so hows your anxiety now \\s patient: i feel better than i dont have to just buy one cup of coffee \\s therapist: okay so that was stressor \\s patient: but i feel its its miles but but okay but it was \\s therapist: but mostly because experiment that were talking about somewhat easier \\s patient: because i think like insight that you gave me on i hadnt connected safety security i hadnt connected all dots so that was very helpful \\s therapist: so one of we talked about before what do i mag thoughts like adaptive responses right so as youre trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car youre going to have those thoughts still come up adaptive response could be something like well id like you to design it or work with me design it but could be something like i know this will actually have consequence in real world yeah i realized this just how responding internally doesnt take away anxiety necessarily it might but it will help you maybe get through that process yeah yeah does that make sense yeah absolutely theres few things im asking you to do right one to just buy gasoline needed only by gasoline at same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with adaptive responses to compare two \\s patient: yeah gotcha \\s therapist: apparently got it right so i know this wont have real consequence in reality that could be one if you have any others you know you can apply to as well as apply them i know that i can tolerate anxiety yeah seems like youve tolerated for long time its not pleasant its not what you want but you can tolerate \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: maybe another adapter response would be this painful for me but if i can be successful here if i can get rid of things \\s patient: yeah longer term picture yeah \\s therapist: keeping your island moving up to coffee other other behavioral goals like that yeah that makes sense \\s patient: i like that lot \\s therapist: so were kind of attacking anxiety from lot of different angles here okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea \\s patient: yeah i do its been long time but i that i mean behaviors thought processes have been in place for long time so i think itll be challenge but i think you know its time \\s therapist: yeah so well that can be very positive so that you know what i detected there was youre ready to challenge six idea right like i would like to take devils courage yeah yeah so youre ready to say ive had enough you can see clear path of behavior that can help you get through it youre ready to take anxiety on that can be positive adaptive response right like being assertive saying almost like youre talking to anxiety in way okay right but im not gonna let you beat me this time thats what youd be saying to anxiety \\s patient: i like that one yeah \\s therapist: so make note of all these right you can use same one more than once you can mix them up whatever works for you okay but keep applying them as needed through whole process into your home your your no more risk to go by its great yeah cuz it because i think once you get home really thats thats completion of only participating that one transaction right youve left go back to restarting cycle so right youve youve permanently recorded just buying one thing yeah so thats victory yeah thatd be huge victory so i dont know if you know status of your gas tank right now do you foresee needing to get gas between now next week \\s patient: oh yeah you do need to do that yeah \\s therapist: so if you could try that out if you could record kind of in moment like after its over experience in terms of your feelings different stages that would be helpful \\s patient: okay \\s patient: okay all right thanks",
            "The patient is anxious about the shopping habit that they have. The patient feels to buy everything in pairs of two. The patient has the urge to look for another things around the store if they have only one thing to buy. They are okay to not buy anything at all too. The patient clarifies it applies to any money transactions which has to be two or zero. The patient experiences worse anxiety when they enter a shop without knowing the second item. The patient believes that this behavior is linked to their personal and family's safety. They feel vulnerable. The patient feels relieved when they buy two items. The patient can have bearable anxiety triggered just be talking about one transactions. The therapist suggests to buy one coffee, and once it is done a 100 times, the patient's anxiety would get exhausted. The patient agrees to try and affirms they didn't feel to link this to safety and security. This can reduce their symptoms. The therapist gives another suggestion to buy gasoline alone and get back home. If they successfully get back home, that a mark of completion and victory to the patient. The therapist asks to respond them with adaptive response for the two, and make note of their experience."

okay you have some pretty big dreams its great its really exciting to think about that be looking forward to future those things \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right well one thing im going to ask you about you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether its you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that heres little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self determination spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life \\s patient: um i think sense of community belonging \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: i think those two respect respect \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: yeah well i think community belonging i kind of related them you know i said i was in marching band i really you know i really enjoy being in like that team setting of you know being with other people all working toward together towards that one goal then in terms of respect i i kind of view that as one of like my major like roles like i really do think respect important to respect myself respect those around me \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: i placed great importance to them \\s therapist: okay great so sort of being part of group being part of team gives you sense of belonging like you said sort of sense of purpose \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: then respect really sort of all encompassing not just authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates other people around you \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: okay thats great all right well one of things i want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends \\s patient: um sometimes if you just you know go to movies go to beach like i said or sometimes we just get together at someones house play some board games hang out \\s therapist: when youre hanging out with friends there ever alcohol involved \\s patient: yeah sometimes \\s therapist: okay can you tell me little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene \\s patient: well its mostly just for for parties or party settings kind of to get things going get everything loosened up as they say \\s therapist: mm hmm so when you go to parties most of time theres alcohol there \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay how often do you think you would say youre drinking \\s patient: id say im on not busy month for instance id say about like two weekends out of month to three \\s therapist: so about half time youre drinking half time youre not \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: can you tell me whats different about days when you choose to drink versus not to drink \\s patient: days that we drink are mostly like i said theyre parties so its more of that whole partying dancing you know having everyone have fun then when we dont its lot more relaxed its lot more hanging out playing board games watching movie \\s therapist: so it really depends on what activity whether or not alcohol there \\s patient: yeah definitely \\s therapist: okay do you notice big difference or can you tell me about difference in your enjoyment level at say party versus night youre playing board games \\s patient: i think of them as as different i think you know night in playing board games things its meant to be relaxing so its nice to have like that kind of breather versus with party its lot more energetic its after at all its very draining mm hmm but in moment its quite fun to dance have fun \\s therapist: okay so theyre sort of pros cons \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: okay what are things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol \\s patient: um its you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because i guess were not you know everyones drinking together were lot more loosened up relaxed not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when its too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad \\s therapist: okay so sort of in too much drinking or at times can you tell me some of less good things are not so good things about alcohol \\s patient: lot of times itll make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions things like that we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so well like sleep over friends house you know were not driving its mostly within our friend group so were not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of ideas people can have when theyre stupid when theyre drunk can be really stupid \\s therapist: okay so youre trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre trying to stay put youre not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust but yeah it sounds like theres still some some things happening \\s patient: sometimes yeah \\s therapist: can you tell me little bit about that \\s patient: well i especially dont like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much we have like throwing up or things like that i dont thats not fun \\s therapist: yeah throwing up never fun \\s patient: yeah its not \\s therapist: how often do you think that happens \\s patient: for me thats happened to me once it was first time i ever drank it was it was lot i didnt know what i was doing i was mixing all kinds of weird things just kind of taking anything anyone gave me that didnt end well but after that i havent but i do have friends that that still do sometimes so ill end up like having to take care of them or something it kind of puts it down on my on my fun \\s therapist: uh huh okay so on one side some of fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree let loose little bit more on other hand theres little bit more i guess planning involved because you have to make sure that youre doing it safely or as safe as you can then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if its not you that sometimes youre stuck your fun sort of ruined when youre stuck dealing with friend who drink too much okay other not so good things about alcohol \\s patient: people can get little sloppy i guess like theyre all loose like with people corners doing things that should be done in private \\s therapist: that kind of stuff so youre kind of stuck being exposed to things \\s patient: yeah got it \\s therapist: all right well you mentioned couple times that youve made few decisions to try limit dangerous aspect of drinking why did you make those decisions \\s patient: i just i you know have an aunt who an alcoholic so i i see like issues that are involved in ive seen movies things i know that junk drives an issue so i you know i want to be as safe as possible in those terms be in setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like someones house or parents at home or something but so i like i know that there are dangers involved i guess i want to limit that still be able to have fun \\s therapist: okay it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect to so on one hand you drinking maybe helps with belonging community to start if theres too much then it sort of defeats purpose \\s patient: right \\s therapist: then with respect one of things you mentioned really wanting to respect yourself not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that drinking fits in with that \\s patient: in terms of what in terms of respect \\s therapist: yes \\s patient: i think well in way i do think that drinking probably form of disrespect to my own body because im not putting things im putting things then that shouldnt be there okay then but in terms of highways i am respecting myself i am im respecting myself by like trying to stay in someones house like trying to limit my drinking so i dont get to that blacked out like that calling up everything try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so im not going to go to some random person i may into i dont know where to do i dont know what things like that \\s therapist: okay so youre sort of looking for that balance \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how much you can drink to have some of positive benefit but not crossover okay what have you come up with at this point do you have sort of limit that you stick to or \\s patient: i usually will i start off by making sure that i make my own drink so i know whats in it how much isnt it so that way i control how much i drink so ill usually just you know get one of those cups then make one drink then ill try to make it last as long as possible ill be like alright this my one drink im good that way i still have something in my cup so people arent going to be like oh here have some more like no im good i have mine ill still be you know having some to like let loose little \\s therapist: do you feel like thats working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think \\s patient: for most part it works pretty well because like i said people you know if people come asking you trying to pressure me ill be like no im good i have you know i still have some like ill get some later then never end up getting anything but sometimes theyll be like hey lets take shot everyones gathered around like kitchen or something ready to take shot then at that point ill be like oh well maybe i can take one more thats when i start you know falling into too much \\s therapist: so portion of time its working well for you another portion of time you maybe you like youd like to make some adjustments to make it little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values your goals for yourself \\s patient: id like to make sure that i you know in terms of respecting myself my body id like to you know try to drink less okay like you know it nice to let loose have fun but id also like it to be so you know im not damaging my body i like my liver doesnt work by time im like 22 you know have my friends on board with similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as group as community \\s therapist: uh huh so kind of combined goals \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: okay so youre you have goal it sounds like actually cutting back on your drinking how important it to you to work on that goal on on scale of one to 10 where one not at all important 10 its most important thing right now \\s patient: id say about like like six or seven oh like to work on it but you know if i get around to it i get around to if i dont i dont hmm \\s therapist: well whyd you say six or seven rather than like four \\s patient: um because i still think its its important uh huh i still you know like i said i dont want my body try especially going to med school like i know how things affect your body also affect your your social your schoolwork things like that i know that once i get to college its not its not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend then like trying to wake up early go to school take an exam like i know thats not thats not feasible its not good idea \\s therapist: yeah looking ahead you cant keep drinking this way reach goals that you have for yourself okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to i think on that same scale from one to 10 \\s patient: i think if i made decision that i was going to for sure then i think definitely like 10 i know i can \\s therapist: oh wow okay why do you say 10 \\s patient: its just because i know that once i make decision i know i can do it uh huh making decision in first place \\s therapist: okay so you mentioned you know quite few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that \\s patient: um im thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know lets just stay in today like lets not go out or something or just be like hey im not like im not gonna drink today then even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around not doing it then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking then doing whatever they want \\s therapist: so sort of trying to plan more activities that dont involve alcohol then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than youre drinking okay does that sound like goal you want to work on now or \\s patient: i think so i think its its very feasible i think its possible \\s therapist: okay so i guess well talk about less alcohol activities im just making some notes to myself then maybe reducing amount of drinking that youre doing if alcohol involved okay \\s patient: i think so thats good \\s therapist: does that sound like something youd like to do \\s patient: yash \\s therapist: okay well i really appreciate you spending time talking to me you know it sounds like you have lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals going to medical school you know becoming psychiatrist or some some other form of physician youre really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there it sounds like you have pretty active social life lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol that you know theres lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health your school performance even some of social stuff in terms of feeling sense of belonging without having to deal with some of gross consequences of drinking too much \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have good plan in place as long as youre willing interested in meeting again id be very excited to be able to talk with you about how its going \\s patient: yeah i like it \\s therapist: alright great so ill plan to see you then in few more weeks",

            "Patient came to the clinic for a complaint of left elbow pain, and it\u2019s pain that patient mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. It\u2019s a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which patient notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that\u2019s when it seems to be at its worst. It\u2019s gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when patient was helping husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. So about a six to seven on a pain scale. And patient describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells therapist that it\u2019s getting kind of in the way of doing some things that patient want to report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint completely. You\u2019ve taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you\u2019ve taken that several times a day now with without much relief that it hasn\u2019t helped much. Patient also tried a heating pad, patient tried some ice, that hasn\u2019t really helped either too much. It sounds like you know, again, you kept referring to it as an as a nuisance. It\u2019s just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. It Doesn\u2019t necessarily keep you up at night. But you do notice it at night when you wake up that it\u2019s still going on for you. So sleep doesn\u2019t seem to help much."

lets have critic thats inside that internal critic thats advocating for settling down for getting married for having kids in way it represents societal pressure did those two sides seem separate to you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you feel like you can be emotional self here an internal critic there \\s patient: i think so okay \\s therapist: so i think you remember how this work shell be hell be talking to this case internal critic right so internal critics on side of settling down getting married then when youre ready to have critic respond youll switch that chair respond to emotional needs driven wanting some make sense okay so whenever youre ready go ahead speak directly to internal critic \\s patient: i want to finish what im doing i want to finish what i started ive

statement are you ready to switch okay good switch so i use internal critic \\s patient: theres always time to pursue career but i need to focus on whats expected of me at this time on best age for having kids i have loving boyfriend who ready wants to get married settle down you are being selfish by just following path that you can take at any time \\s therapist: an internal critic cues in emotional side in this case career side been selfish notice your posture very linear youre upright i noticed you kind of put your hand down little bit when youre talking try to think of internal critics body movements try to act that out little bit okay \\s patient: think its accusation you know i think i like i just wanted to like tell emotional part that its being stupid that its you know youre youre youre not acting in best interest of everyone else jump at it \\s therapist: youre gonna jump at emotional side \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so thats internal critic they respond back to term critic from emotional side \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so internal critic just called selfish one of things response \\s patient: i feel like im being attacked i dont think its wrong to think about myself what i am truly passionate about \\s therapist: let me interrupt you so your hands are pointing back toward career emotional self what can you do with your hands that really embody that you want to communicate to internal critic there anything else you want to do \\s patient: pointing towards me to protect myself from what critics saying i just want to like push that back towards critic \\s therapist: so continueand have used that motion there youre youre pushing internal critic away okay \\s patient: so i dont need i dont need to feel guilty you know i dont need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams \\s therapist: does internal critic have something to say back \\s patient: no \\s therapist: so youve youve now pushed emotional side pushed critical way \\s patient: okay i think critic critic feels like it understands where emotional side of me coming from you know like i can recognize why its so important then like why working so hard worth that you know sense of accomplishment thats going to come with it how its gonna in long run help provide for all these extra things that i want to like my family in future i can see that \\s therapist: alright so internal critic that hands down here internal critic right its an internal critic less angry less assertive \\s patient: less pushy less pushy less pushy yeah its not not as critical truthfully its just i feel like pressure annoying dwayne on either either shoulders \\s therapist: so critic more separated now maybe little bit but also has different outlook \\s patient: more quiet its not like always yelling at me because i think it i mean sometimes it might still say something but not in like urgency that it had before \\s therapist: so critic has lost some of its vigor determination \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: to move back to emotional \\s patient: i feel calmer i feel like you know critic has always been part of me but that part of me its more like you know its its not as assertive its not as you know intense right now its call i think that emotional part of me was able to win argument per se you know just because thats you know what i want \\s therapist: so at end of this conflict after we split into two parts here they have this conflict eventually decision decision to pursue career or settle down do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision \\s patient: yeah because i feel like i you know i can stay on my decision in has you know has been to stay on my career path but now i feel less guilty for doing it \\s therapist: so thats thats really been your decision all along but internal critic was harassing you this whole time \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: today youre able to kind of shove that internal critic back little allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with decision youve made \\s patient: yeah that i very much \\s therapist: do you feel helpful technique \\s patient: yeah i do i you know i think that separating two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger \\s therapist: so he was able to give you some clarity \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: right all right well lets once reflect on whats happened here between now next session okay bye guys kind of lot happened it seems like youve gained clarity for your decision then well pick up with next session see how things have progressed with see if that internal critic still harassing you or if it kind of stays back if you have more peace with decision thats not like plan",
            "A part of the patient wishes to settle down, but they also wish to pursue their career. The therapist suggests to do a role-play with internal critics to settling down on one side and responding for their emotional needs on the other side. The patient acting as critic is accused of being selfish and the critic responds that the emotional side is being stupid and it is not acting in the best interest of everyone. The patient feels attacked and they wish to protect themselves from what the critic is saying. The patient feels the critic understands the emotional side and seems less assertive. The patient feels calmer. The patient has some clarity after enacting that they wish to pursue a career or settle down. Role-play has helped the patient realize which side they felt stronger. The therapist confirms to pick this up in the next session and have a check if the patient's internal critic is still harassing the patient. "

you kind of understand that \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so i know last time i said we talked about your lack of confidence so for example i know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana depression you had problems with depression you also had anger issues out of those which one do you think you ought to put up to discuss today \\s patient: probably angry i feel like thats biggest problem \\s therapist: okay coming over about driver issues \\s patient: i mean its not like im just like an angry person that just like snaps in any light but i getdefensive i guess im very defensive she lashed out but ive never ive lashed out my child summary its usually always my husband \\s therapist: can you telll me about last time you lost your anger \\s patient: we were unloading groceries i actually had just had my hair done cut in color i was so excited i thought he was gonna love it you know he looked at it he of course paid how much money did it cost \\s therapist: yeah things are kind of expensive \\s patient: so total you know would have been 60 he told me that you know weve been struggling with money lately little bit then i didnt need to spend that much money that selfish \\s therapist: okay so now what im writing down here kind of like what we talked about how theres no family situation you know thought you have an emotion so i know like what you were just saying event or situation was that you got your hair done that he was angry about that \\s patient: yeah okay he was yeah he was just saying mean things \\s therapist: okay okay now what did you in that moment when he was being mean what was now how youfelt but what was your actual thought when he was saying all that stuff \\s patient: im selfish you bought them selfish okay yeah initially yeah that was that was it right that was selfish when you actually thought selfish guilty guilty sad angry angry very angry that he made me feel about what i was doing that way im going forward he said that then once he said thatyou know he put that thought in my head it made me angry \\s therapist: okay so when he when when he was getting mad at you then telling you youre selfish you felt substrate got yourself im selfish then you got angry what did you do after you get angry \\s patient: yeah smack \\s therapist: okay okay \\s patient: yep \\s therapist: there was physical contact there \\s patient: yeah i hit him upside his head okay i mean i felt that afterwards didnt need to its just also mad that right yeah hey you feel that way uh huh i just lashed out okay \\s therapist: so when he when he has these he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this how do you think you could change from smacking him to having more calm positive response \\s patient: i think if i was able to get same thing \\s therapist: how do you think you might be able to do that \\s patient: umm \\s therapist: like this how we would do it with cbt we would change your thought so what he gets upset with you calls you selfish you start to feel selfish \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so how could you not feel selfish even if you changed your thought \\s patient: yeah i mean if i never even thought that i was selfish then i would have been angry \\s therapist: so do you think youre selfish \\s patient: maybe time i did die i felt like awful but now like he says wording for money but were really not one might want to pay our bills or i want to do things i mean hes just kind of like cheap person we have plenty of money to were not hurting at all i do not feel confidence i dont think it was selfish to make myself feel prettier you know but i think people do have their selfish tendencies \\s therapist: so im hearing you say you dont think youre selfish at all \\s patient: oh i mean im selfish actuation you dont know if youre being selfish i really i really dont know if i had gone bought whole new wardrobe with it but man i just did my hair he had pizza real estate agent they had sold big house that week so we had enough money for me to afford it okay \\s therapist: so instead of thinking im selfish what could you actually think \\s patient: i deserve this then how me sometimes \\s therapist: i deserve this \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i mean who doesnt deserve something every now then right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so if you were thinking i deserved that that was your thought when he was getting angry he thought no im sorry this how do you think that would actually make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point i drives you so confident \\s patient: yeah confident in my decision i would still feel real sad that paint off but i dont think it would be to level that it was thought was selfish \\s therapist: so if you felt competent about your decision because you actually changed your thought do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think theres no need for this \\s patient: yeah i think it would help me realize that thats his issue not mine \\s therapist: right so how do you think youd actually behave them \\s patient: walk off okay or he will be able to this kind of what im wanting to get to as well be able to suppress it no man he didnt deserve for me to hit him he didnt he said something that upset me but no one deserves that \\s therapist: right so maybe im so thinking also that youre selfish when hes getting my back could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me he just doesnt understand maybe i need to tell him that i do deserve this explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself \\s patient: yeah yeah i could try that \\s therapist: because you know you know youre not selfish its just something that makes you feel good \\s patient: i think also he understood why i did it because i mean he knows that i have some subconscious issues but i dont think he realizes how bad it was or why i got my hair cut encasing it as she said most girly things you never asked me feel better about myself you know not be as well okay which goes back to this precedent so right okay \\s therapist: so do you think in like in next coming week that you could actually change your thoughtsin targeted change how you feel \\s patient: i could try yeah \\s therapist: yeah okay okay okay since we talked about your angry sheets i know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression youre also having marijuana use either one of those would you want to discuss or i mean would you like to discuss your you know your anger issues further \\s patient: i like to talk about depression \\s therapist: okay what do you think triggers your depression what makes you depressed \\s patient: umm well my son kind of at age where he has only been involved in why kind of always been housewife hes been hes always been my wife you know i did everything with him on my daughters practices but his mom boy that not mommys little boy anymore so now hes kind of growing up doing his own thing then \\s therapist: how old your son \\s patient: hes 14 \\s therapist: okay so interesting age \\s patient: yeah so hes kind of coming in little man who said that he probably offended but like i dont know if thats where it comes from honor that thats here lately you know im used to being at home i stay with friends i call myself lot or he doesnt like for me to call more no more kisses you know i know that its normal but it still makes me feel really depressed \\s therapist: okay okay so situation here that your son doesnt want to be involved with you as much \\s patient: yeah no hes just grown up \\s therapist: okay have you know what do you think to yourself when he doesnt want to talk to mom anymore he doesnt want to be mom hes out doing his own thing \\s patient: no i mean like it does freak i was checking on football player youre gonna believe it but bigger bigger he he says taking on your dog he got upset at me because he felt like i was getting in this business trying to mommy you know were not just trying to make sure that he was going to be able to make it there on time that he had all clothes necessary i asked him if he needed rod things like that i just felt like i was betting in this business it just made me feel like im not needed anymore \\s therapist: so when you what your exact thought though when when this stuff happens \\s patient: do not feel good about it \\s therapist: yeah thats hard when you when youve always been needed before \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i fee like what kind of motion you are feeling \\s patient: like sad i was really sad \\s therapist: in turn what did you what did you do in that situation \\s patient: umm i dont know \\s therapist: okay do you think you use marijuana also because youre pressed \\s patient: yeah yeah ive never used it before i mean it just started like when when i started to feel sad so yeah \\s therapist: okay so what are you saying for me if im wrong that you know your son doesnt want to be involved anymore you dont feel like youre needed thats what you say to yourself that makes you feel sad lonely then in turn you use marijuana \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so you dont want to do you want to use marijuana \\s patient: no i mean i dont want my son if he ever found out like i would be getting employment \\s therapist: okay thats okay so what what i kind of want you to do for for next session kind of what we were continuing what we were doing last week you know how you journaled when you have negative thought that you changed it to positive thought then in turn you solve it like how it could change your behavior \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so do you think you could do that again \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: like when tom such as when your son you know its kind of goes along around you think instead of im not eating stuff like am i eating more thinking you know hes growing up thats good appraised of you know son that active who enjoying life then how does that make you feel if you actually thought to yourself \\s patient: i mean yeah i mean that might make me feel better yeah \\s therapist: you know because hes probably in good place active social one good person because of you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so that would make you happy i would think then no maybe then you could you know have different behavior do something different \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so journaling does that sound good \\s patient: yeah ill try",
            "Patient have lack of confidence. Patient is improving slighly but uses marijuana. Patient\u2019s son doesn't want to be involved anymore. You don't feel like you're needed. That's what you say to yourself and that makes you feel sad and lonely. And then in turn you use marijuana."

\\s therapist: can you tell me about whats been going on \\s patient: yeah for past past maybe couple weeks i guess few weeks i have these morning meetings once week at work i have to make presentation every time i go to present its my turn i start getting start getting really nervous \\s therapist: start getting really nervous so your morning meeting at work so does each person at meeting present in like row \\s patient: yeah yeah we all take turn \\s therapist: theyll take turns when you start to feel nervous when its your time to talk or before or after that now \\s patient: im usually guy at start of meeting because i know im gonna have to theres about 10 of us i always seem to be one of last few to go like like six or seven kind of in line to present \\s therapist: says around 10 people at meeting yeah as luck would have it you tend to be toward end so can you describe whats happening say for beginning of meeting in terms of what youre experiencing \\s patient: hmm sowhen i walk in im usually okay you know say good morning to everybody then my my boss calls means order thats usually when it starts like kind of starts like maybe like butterflies in my stomach kinda then after he makes his report then it just starts going around room my heart starts to be faster my palms get sweaty i just i just start to feel really nervous ive realized that i might be kind of i start to tune out some of other presentations because i i start to become focused on how im feeling \\s therapist: i focused focused on physical sensation being nervous mental sensation youre not really hearing what theyre saying \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: theyre saying \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so go on so so these you have these physical symptoms this nervousness what happens \\s patient: yeah \\s patient: by time it its my turn to present i start i just im almost like just almost shaking yeah i noticed that my hands are little little off so keep my hands down like in my lap just that i dont want anybody to see them shaking like that i have paper in front of me that i just kind of read from but when i start reading my my voice little shaky i kind of stutter tripped over my words i just i feel like im not making good presentations then its not looking good to my boss \\s therapist: so so in moment when youre when its your turn to present youre still feeling that same nervousness like that doesnt that doesnt go away at all youre trying to hold your body kind of still like like almost cube control \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: yeah then your voice this kind of sounds like crackly or breaking up as youre trying to read from like bullet points like wanna \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: like an outline \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what happens when you have read last read last point \\s patient: well when im done its it takes little bit for everything to calm down but i im then im consumed by idea that my boss thinks i did terrible job that hes you know hes regretting putting me in this position that i cant make good records or you know that i didnt report right stuff right information to him so it doesnt really go away it just its almost like my mind shift someone im anxious about \\s therapist: alright so then nervousness thats stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away replaced by more general feeling nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you yeah because of presentation quality \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: because as youre presenting kind of staying still your voice crackling hes picking up on that youre aware of that \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how how long have you noticed this these symptoms that appear in this way \\s patient: um when you when i was an undergrad in college i had to make some presentations from time to time i would get nervous when i would make presentations i just i mean most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe thats what it was so you know just doing presentation in front of like 30 something people so it didnt really didnt really bother me letters i figured it was just normal always got you know decent grades on my presentation so it never really bothered me so i really feel like its only been an issue in last few weeks \\s therapist: last few weeks when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right \\s therapist: do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to whats going on \\s patient: um im not sure if it if it has any bearing my my mom she she i know she doesnt like to speak in public i used to talk to her about how i feel nervous about making presentations school you know shoots oh you can buy it on its tiny you know so i dont know if that means anything \\s therapist: so whatever you have going on you think that maybe maybe she has that going on to \\s patient: maybe \\s therapist: same same set of symptoms at least \\s therapist: yeah i mean ive asked her you know ive told her about this she hasnt been in situation where shes had to to do this kind of presentations like in small group like this so i dont i cant compare it to that but i mean she has said that shes gotten nervous before \\s therapist: any feelings of sadness or anything like that \\s patient: yeah like after i do after i make presentation at work then i do start feeling really sad you know like i said because then i feel like my boss isnt satisfied with my performance that hes gonna regret his decision to give me this position so yeah it definitely makes me sad i feel disappointed in myself \\s therapist: do you have any substance use going on alcohol anything else \\s patient: now i have drink every now then its very very rare \\s therapist: in these i know this something recent for you but in these meetings so far has nervousness ever caused you to leave room before they came around to your turn \\s patient: no no ive ive managed to control it i guess to where i can stay there like i said ive kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting i feel bad about that too because i feel like they have important information to share with me i should give them same respect of paying attention but id become focused on on on whats going on inside like my heart eating you know my hands so i cant i zone out on them sometimes but but no i i pushed through it i do my presentation \\s therapist: are you ever worried about what theyre thinking about she mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you ever worried about what other workers at table thinking about \\s patient: yeah times cuz i feel like you know im newest member of management team so i feel like theyre kinda like what up with this chick i cant she get it together but you know theres theres been one person whos been really supportive you know shes been like hey you did great today great information things like that so that kind of helps me feel better but i guess at end of day to me its really my bosss opinion that matters because hes my boss \\s therapist: have you ever felt you mentioned youre nervous at beginning of meeting have you ever felt nervous well in advance of meeting \\s patient: im when im preparing like that morning to go to work thats one of those like okay i got this meeting at nine i start to think about i like on my way into work but i dont i dont start feeling anything until im actually in room \\s therapist: so have you noticed nervousness fairly intense pretty much only at these meetings its been bothering you for few weeks something new something little frightening for you well get you set up with treatment ill get you in to see somebody in next few days if that works for you \\s patient: yeah thatd be great \\s therapist: i appreciate you spending this time with me

            "therapist: today \\s patient: ive been working still on fear of leaving home for extended periods of time like vacation its been little harder recently because i have this plan trip with friend of mine coming up in few months thats kind of been weighing on my mind \\s therapist: whereas trip to \\s patient: georgia \\s therapist: how long way \\s patient: she wants to go like six days yeah im not sure with work school everything i can make full six days plus im little nervous to go that long \\s therapist: so thats long time for you \\s patient: it yes \\s therapist: so when did you discover this trip was going to be \\s patient: actually last just few days ago she messaged me said hey you want to go with me well go golfing swimming i love golfing like i know i want to go but i just had these just little nervous about leaving \\s therapist: little nervous so when she made that call \\s patient: i was just couple days ago was first thought he had kind of i cant go that long that was my first thought thats thats too long but he was like wow this would be great i want to go down there golfing so bad get away from cold weather so i mean my immediate thought was no not that long but yes im gonna go \\s therapist: alright so so to kind of conflicting thoughts right so one one like never go that long six days way too long other one that would be enjoyable you enjoy that \\s patient: absolutely \\s therapist: yeah so which way youre leaning right now \\s patient: i want to go to go for six days maybe just like long weekend \\s therapist: 3 4 days \\s patient: two would be ideal but idea of it two three days yeah \\s therapist: so what we think causing this worry about being gone more than two days \\s patient: i dont know i mean ive always as late teenager in my 20s ive always had just nervous to leave home i dont as much as i love being home i love to travel to you know do different things its just i guess im just afraid something to happen when im not around \\s therapist: not to youre afraid something will happen to your your house or \\s patient: well i have pets so were about them my parents are getting older so i worry about them mainly like my immediate family mainly i guess my dad because hes had history of heart attacks then my pets thats such as for something to happen i will be there \\s therapist: how about when you were younger you said this problems found for was same thing same thing so mostly family now some pets \\s patient: my pets then to see if thats \\s therapist: yes your feelings are there fighting one another absolutely right now feeling thought anyway have you know i would like to go on trip winning but fear thought was kind of dragging dragging you down yeah so whats sensation of anxiety here \\s patient: yeah i get anxious yeah my heart gets feels like its heavy my chest feels heavy i just all these thoughts go through my mind like you know i know my parents um i can watch my pets but they may not take care of them like i would i dont know its just i mean that you know theyve always will take care of all my no but theyll miss me they might tear my house up i dont all these thoughts in my mind that seem crazy to me \\s therapist: so it seems like an endless stream of worries yeah surrounding family pets what might happen so really thats thats it right this what might happen its uncertainty right so anything ever happened \\s patient: no no \\s therapist: okay so so far all worrying anxiety really hasnt paid me dividends \\s patient: yes now that im older when i was younger i probably wouldnt like it overnight but now that im older yes i do i just say i got to live my life theyll be okay i just try to tell myself theyre in good hands if something happens somebody oh call me but then i feel like oh but i want to be hours away im plane ride away then i get thinking about that but i do go \\s therapist: but you didnt in past \\s patient: no \\s therapist: so something changed what changed \\s patient: i dont knowi really \\s therapist: right so not sure what change but used to not go now you do go so when youre down there or wherever you go in trip youre feeling better like youre enjoying yourself but youre also worried at same time \\s patient: not too well once i get there im usually okay maybe first night i get little worried then maybe when im getting ready to come home im like little anxious im ready to get home to make sure everythings okay \\s therapist: rest of time \\s patient: im usually okay ill get some alcohol involved so he kind of limits my anxiety but once i get into like playing golf all that i really do allow myself to enjoy it its just it seems like its going coming thats \\s therapist: alright so problem really isnt when youre there problem now leading up to it maybe just first half day your day when youre there maybe last half day or two there \\s patient: its like plane like i dont have problem right like flying out but its thinking like while im waiting for plane like whoa what if we what if terrorist on there what if we crash ill think about all that before but once im there on plane right take off im fine im completely fine not anxious its leading up to actual event that makes me anxious \\s therapist: i suppose anticipation so thats thats worst part all right so period between now when you leave its gonna be worst part \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: but shell probably stock up \\s patient: probably but ill have changed my mind probably dozen times before actually say yes \\s therapist: when you do go on twitter \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: something could happen certainly sure but it hasnt so far \\s patient: i dont know i try not to think that for \\s therapist: alright so youll youll return \\s patient: yeah still doesnt stop me from worrying when i get these trips planned \\s therapist: yeah so probabilities of it really doesnt that doesnt alleviate worry worry still there right even though you know worry probably going to transition to enjoyment looking forward to that that doesnt \\s patient: no not at all \\s therapist: that doesnt leave anything at all \\s patient: like i gotta get my house cleaned up make sure my animals or everyday have enough food i preparing to leave \\s therapist: preparing productive right yeah that makes sense yeah well how would thoughts see you feel more connected to warring \\s patient: probably like like i want to i want to say i dont know i really its kind of word like i want to like i cant say bye not to my parents or i cant you know say bye enough to my pets like i feel like i like i dont i dont know i dont really care thats i guess part of problem i dont know what im connecting it to \\s therapist: so if you dont tell them goodbye enough time \\s patient: yeah i dont know maybe i sound so \\s therapist: oh it sounds like maybe if you dont say if you dont say goodbye enough times settled that that youll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it \\s patient: maybe \\s therapist: so that so thats focal point of this things night in some way right \\s patient: let me go for few days \\s therapist: way you start to let go when you tell them \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so so what do you find yourself doing you say goodbye then then leave then come back or \\s patient: do i just finally say bye ill talk to you later love you you know ill check in when i land or whatever then thats it then its like i just have to try to breathe just put those thoughts behind me because once i say it its like okay thats it im gone \\s therapist: but youre but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in say you should have said goodbye one more time \\s patient: no i just know that doesnt come to my mind \\s therapist: that you didnt say goodbye well enough \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: property was property of saying goodbye this you feel like youre not doing well enough \\s patient: maybe its just fact that im leaving i shouldnt leave say that you know maybe i feel like i maybe its just guilt of leaving \\s therapist: so act of leaving itself leave shoot guilty what are you guilty of \\s patient: not being there if something happens \\s therapist: so abandon \\s patient: maybe \\s therapist: for short time neglecting them for short time \\s patient: probably maybe i did feel little guilty \\s therapist: now youre in more of caregiver role than you were then \\s patient: maybe little bit i mean ive always been im youngest of mine me my sister but my parents have always looked up to me to be responsible one make sure everythings taken care of so i probably kind of loud myself to take on that role of caregiver moreso or be at more responsible one of two \\s therapist: so to be responsible one there needs to be guilt when you leave i guess \\s patient: maybe i should stay home be responsible person they dont make me feel guilty they say go have good time your babys ugly okay well take care of what i mean i know theyre in good hands thats thats whats makes it so difficult i know theyll be okay but i just feel like probably shouldnt go \\s therapist: so theres not another person driving skill towards you thats me just coming in from side \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so if i if i leave well im responsible if i leave something bad will happen thatll be on me \\s patient: now when theyre to fix it or take care of it or make it better like i put it on somebody else that have to do with that yeah \\s therapist: so fear of being caught as irresponsible \\s patient: maybe yeah \\s therapist: you could be few left to just take you days travel or whatever however far away \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: right so yeah but thats thats still doesnt help relieve anxiety now when you come back because \\s patient: no not really because its like i want immediate access like i want to be able to be right there within minutes if they need me \\s therapist: have you ever taken trip that was like within \\s patient: i mean not its not as bad but yeah theres back there stay with us for an overnight theres some of way up sometimes im thinking i should just stay home or i could be right in same town sometimes that if im i wake up at five in morning i just get up go home because i just get really start feeling really anxious i want to be home \\s therapist: so closer you are it helps little bit it sounds like good part of anxiety still there so it really doesnt matter where you go its fact that youre not home fact that youre not able to fully be responsible in way that you view it \\s patient: when i work 12 hour shifts i have to work overnight i will most of time take my break go there between chuck on pima benson \\s therapist: so at 20 thats long shift so 20 hour shift at what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts \\s patient: probably usually like six seven hours into it just depends like now its getting dark so when it kind of gets dark if i dont leave light on or something i get little anxious i feel like i need to go home leave light on you know just let my pets know im coming back kind of weird but i know they miss me then but if im busy then i dont really think about it so if you know if im busy at work doing something i dont really think about until i stop what im doing right slow down im thinking wow i got 10 more hours or eight more hours sometimes i go home sometimes they dont sometimes its worse than others \\s therapist: right so if youre busy at work same reality exists meaning your pets are alone but way youre responding to it different yeah youre less anxious \\s patient: maybe because i know im close i can get there i know im in control well be able to go there \\s therapist: well im buddy lets say not at work lets say when youre on vacations in those days in middle when youre enjoying yourself that distraction like more you enjoy yourself last year \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but same reality exists there alone so really its your way ofwhich way of viewing things thats leading to anxiety its not necessarily whats actually happening \\s patient: its my perception \\s therapist: your perception of whats happening what could happen i guess in this case not so much what happening what you worried could could \\s patient: definitely \\s therapist: because nothings happened yet \\s patient: no not yet \\s therapist: so how many well theres i guess theres few different theres few different issues here right how many vacations you take year \\s patient: i dont really take long vacations ive taken only ive only taken like two week long vacations ever for like five six days i was fine well same anxiety when i was younger now its more like long weekends or you know night here or there i dont really take long vacations but probably maybe three or four times year im like go away overnight versus just not just friends house like an actual vacation where i go into city or something \\s therapist: sort of small proportion of time so just looking in terms of probabilities you risk very low because youre not quite that much but other issue that even at work youre still having same feelings even for short trips youre still have same feelings so youre really limiting things xietymuch of time \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: its been this way for years \\s patient: probably since teenager he hasnt stopped me ive always where every now i work more than ever im more it doesnt stop me from working kind of overtime working three jobs doesnt stop me but i mean like i said in as teenager early 20s it did i would just be like on my way out somewhere to go stay night my boyfriend was like nope i cant do it not to come home but now that doesnt happen may not i may not go for week long vacation but ill go for few nights \\s therapist: so youre functioning \\s patient: oh yeah \\s therapist: approved yeah hes actually pretty good working lot sounds like \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: because this uncomfortable anxiety this painful for you \\s patient: yeah i mean it doesnt like so it doesnt really seem to stop me from working obviously because i work its just leading up to leaving for work or \\s therapist: going on vacation alright so lets say \\s patient: well think about making sure i have everything i need for work you know dont have i usually take my dinner \\s therapist: do you feel less anxious when you with those prevention okay so that helps right so physically preparing your house so that your pets are safer that helps you so what else going through your mind so you do that right you take all precautions you can to keep them safe prepare your dinner for work everything so whats next thought \\s patient: just gotta go to work i just think about ill come home later you know if i get break i mean usually i do especially if i do overnight as i got downtime so run home check on then im off to work then i kind of forget about it then i said some lights burned out not every night i come home check off but some nights i just get started feel anxious get thinking about them i go on trip \\s therapist: so every time when you felt anxious you wanted to check on them but you couldnt leave \\s patient: for now from out working with clients yeah so what \\s therapist: happens then terms of thinking feeling \\s patient: i dont dwell on it because my focus with client so it just kind of think about it i need to get home but you know i just focus back on client i dont let it overwhelm me or \\s therapist: well just so it doesnt change your function but society has their anxiety associated with \\s patient: it goes away i mean i want what im thinking about but then it goes away \\s therapist: alright so depending on what youre thinking about that can change level of anxiety youre experiencing \\s patient: theres something or yeah \\s therapist: okay so theres that that thought youre having something like that \\s patient: about older cats i mean hes really old something cool you know what if you know hes somethings happened to hell i mean i dont honestly thinking im dying but i think you know what he needs because he has hes really old so i do think about him \\s therapist: i still have that you have that thought like \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: so you can see power of thinking all this right so reality of your cats health well being hasnt changed way you view it as change way you think about it so we talked about before this idea of adaptive response right so thoughts youre having now that lead to anxiety we believe could lead to anxiety theyre automatic right theyre just popping in your head right its triggered by certain things like getting ready to leave for work being at work while look at time realizing something we have cats right but thats an automatic that just comes without like you cant necessarily stop right \\s patient: just comes naturally when im getting ready to leave \\s therapist: then anxiety right there so adaptive response we also call self talk thats thats thought that you can give that you can create consciously right you can think to yourself so its not automatic its not an adjustment of an automatic thought its thought that you can deliberately think almost like repeating sentence that youve memorized you can at will choose to do that that makes sense so i want to make sure i draw distinction some thoughts just pop in other thoughts you deliberately like when we found if you have thought that you deliberately think we call adaptive response it can counter feelings caused by automatic thoughts essentially \\s patient: youre challenging youre disputing that automatic thought this be my own thoughts \\s therapist: youre just spinning your thoughts yeah so you know i want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses i want you to have most of site all sites you want because i think that you can develop ones that are useful to you but just to give an example when you havent thought that you know older cat can be sick right adaptive response could be or could be wide wide variety of thoughts but one could be its not likely right like you know or if it likely that you know hell probably be okay if its he or she okay hell probably be okay till i get home another adaptive response could be it would be sad unfortunate something happened but i have my work responsibilities at some point i have to leave cats alone \\s patient: i do tell them that i tell them thank them i feel like them that well does someone want sometimes i run from me when i try to kiss them goodbye im like oh no what i have to go to work because you will have to eat i know it sounds silly but i do tell him that then i kind of thinks it does most things i think i didnt realize thats kind of what i was but i do do that sometimes \\s therapist: so youre actively responding \\s patient: yeah but i didnt realize thats what i was doing but yeah i do say that to myself to them yeah \\s therapist: well i think thats productive adaptive response i mean you know youre right if you dont if you dont earn income then theyll have worse problems \\s patient: yeah i cant take care of them being left alone \\s therapist: so really good working youre youre being more of service to them protecting them more so \\s patient: yeah thats true i never thought of it that way \\s therapist: so that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this this feeling of anxiety \\s patient: then theres times i think you know theyre just cats are probably last to go on \\s therapist: so theyre not striking you as anxious when you get home \\s patient: yeah well sometimes sometimes sometimes after 12 hour shift yes i have one of them she wont show me let me sleep first hour she literally were around again stuff i take it shes mad because ive been gone but shes fine \\s therapist: she continues to survive despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving so that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring mild stressor but sometimes theyre asleep when you get home so \\s patient: yeah thats true \\s therapist: how bad could it be for them \\s patient: yeah they dont know im worrying or anxious they could care less like they dont believe no its not bothering them i mean \\s therapist: yeah i mean their level awareness clearly different than than yours right so yeah i mean thats another good adaptive response that you know much higher level awareness whereas youre not sure that have any awareness that youre experiencing anxiety or maybe little bit with one cat who runs or think they do \\s patient: thats just an animal person but i think they do but yeah i probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do but theyre my kids i treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too yeah \\s therapist: absolutely so its understandable that you would be anxious have concerns but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having successful experience right being okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so you implement behaviors that are practical that ive worked in making house safe keeping plants away from them so i think one route here if youre okay with it would be to use work as like first point i know you have trip i know thats that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking worst but you have more chances well one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because its more or less daily thing right five days week or whatever it so some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together right you could apply those you know think about that responses are not always short right automatic thoughts could be short it can even be images do not necessarily even complete sentences right like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation so its not necessarily spelled out in english like sentence but adaptive responses well they could be images too but ones im talking about are really sentences that youre repeating back consciously to yourself so its important to have them prepared ready to go so i often ask clients to kind of write them out have them available so that when that thought comes about it seems like youre pretty good at identifying you know what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because youve memorized initially youd read automatic thought i mean upside of adaptive response that would counter deal on that thought okay might not first time might not second time but over time we believe it i found that it changes how often how intense to aback thoughts come in conscious thinking adaptive responding does that make sense \\s patient: thats us because like i said i kind of said these things to myself anyway i just didnt realize thats what was probably lessening anxiety because i do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when i say i have to go to work or else you guys wont be able to take care of didnt even dawned on me that thats \\s therapist: youve already adapted yeah youve already used cognitive behavioral techniques in way to reduce anxiety so what were really doing just expanding formalizing what youve already been doing to achieve some success \\s patient: that makes sense definitely yes \\s therapist: so if you could between now next session write down some of adaptive responses that we discussed ones youve already used then work to identify automatic thoughts at work then come up work to identify them then consciously repeat those those that responses back when you have those thoughts okay so youre really repairing self talk adaptive responses with automatic thoughts that thought comes right then you have adaptive response youre repeating it you know its an internal youre pitting just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud although that would surely be okay to not know your coworkers you know respond something like that \\s patient: sorry no i mean ive threatened to put camera in house so i can like theres thing you can you can remote access to your house theres button your animal can push call you ive talked to him at work im like well my cat calls me yall i really thought about it seriously that i could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home i could just look in see what theyre doing i have thought that some of my co workers know i cant worry about them so yeah they would help support me not be so anxious probably \\s therapist: yeah putting in security type measure you could lessen anxiety or it could create anxiety \\s patient: but make it worse \\s therapist: i dont know which you know so i think if youre okay with it well start with adaptive responses \\s patient: yeah id rather do that \\s therapist: see how that works out we have other options putting security systems in such to shy out in future if necessary lets try adaptive responding then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like what your what your thoughts feelings were after you applied it \\s patient: should i like try to measure my level of anxiety absolutely okay \\s therapist: yeah so you know maybe like one to 10 with 10 being worst okay measure it when you first had that experience of it im pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately youve experienced it for long time you suffer with it for long time then after applying adapter response especially after few minutes applying few times maybe shoot for ones see what it that note that again beginning of might not see much of change at all right so be persistent with it okay give it chance to work see how it does okay well start there well kind of review how you do that then well work toward things analyze bigger stressor right well see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that okay so good plan yes",
            "The patient has difficulty leaving home for extended periods of time like vacation. The patients explains a scenario where they are seen to have conflicting thoughts of to go and not to go. The patient has parents and pets to take care of. The patient gets worried if something might happen to them when they are away. The patient feels less anxious if they are busy at work since they can reach home but not the same during a vacation. The therapist confirms, depending on what the patient thinks, it can change the level of anxiety. The therapist advises to use self talk to overcome automatic thoughts of anxiety and discusses adaptive responses useful to the patient. The patient is asked to develop different adaptive responses and read the upside of adaptive response to counter the automatic thought and is requested to try this week and note the adaptive responses down. The therapist also request the patient to measure their anxiety levels."

prevents you from doing it \\s patient: i dont know i mean i guess i know what it would be like for my family i dont want to hurt them \\s therapist: they would be hurt \\s patient: yes its scary i mean thought of dying scary but thought of going on painful \\s therapist: so it almost sounds as if by squaring it down bit \\s patient: yeah i kind of feel like im stuck between rock hard place like i just dont know where to go from here \\s therapist: have you worked out in specific plan or so \\s patient: no i mean you know you know i thought like if i were to do it you know ways but not not specific because i just dont think that i could do it you know like i dont i thought about suicide but i dont like seriously consider it as an option but its starting to like creep into my thoughts it never has before so that im like kind of concerned about that like i guess i know sometimes people like really planted but for me ive its an ive never really considered it before so its really scaryfor me \\s therapist: so this how long been going on this feelings \\s patient: um i think like in past couple of days it started you know more so then like today it was just like first thought

up feeling so down so useless pointless that it makes me wish that i was dead but if i didnt have that feeling then i wouldnt wish that i was dead because i know that my life has value i know that my family would want me around i know theres future for me but my feelings make me feel like my future just dark pointless \\s therapist: alright these suicidal ideations i know youre youre telling me you havent had them before so i can appreciate that theyre scary they could be scary even if you hadnt had them before are fairly common with depression youve it sounds like what youre really saying youre frustrated youre tired of being sick i think that you make valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before it would seem to be very upset when i see your life has value i want to try to hang on to that thought after were done here today tell me what you have planned for us today \\s patient: well i didnt i didnt really have plans because i kind of you know came here feeling like i really needed to see you so i kind of put things on hold but i mean i guess i would go home you know im not really sure \\s therapist: anywhere else

            "therapist: so sam healthy other than some seasonal allergies everything else okay then \\s patient: actually not quite i dont know whats been happening but between last school year this year all of sudden im getting these phone calls from his teacher saying that hes not paying attention in class they think he has adhd all of sudden i mean i dont know where this coming from but this not same kid i had year ago \\s therapist: okay so sounds like theres little bit more going on that some more worries that you wanted to talk about so perhaps it makes sense that that we take few minutes then i chat with you then ill spend few minutes with sam sure itll be great okay sam do you want to go in hang out in waiting room for bed ill come find you in few minutes go ahead honey so tell me about sam issues that hes having in school \\s patient: well hes like totally different kid not in good way all of sudden this year ive been getting calls three four times week from his teacher principal theyre saying things like hes acting out in class hes having little kind of angry spurts all of sudden hes not doing his homework which completely new to me his grades are slipping i mean he used to be like 70s 80s 90s kids now hes getting 60s so this feels like \\s therapist: real diversion from last year real change from last year oh totally like night day okay so it sounds like theres been some problems at home so im going to ask you some screening questions that i asked all parents some of them might fit for you some of them may not probably take about five minutes well just go through them together sure lets do it so why dont we start with how youre doing \\s patient: um honestly im getting by i mean i think you know darrell i got divorced last year hes somewhere out in bc god only knows where \\s therapist: so he seeing sam at all or \\s patient: i think they skype maybe once every couple months but hes really not been in contact hes not been sending money that he promised he would so were not thrilled with him right now \\s therapist: so has that meant that finances have been tight or \\s patient: yeah i mean i was kind of counting on child support to come in you know things are tight with three people household then for almost since long darrens been gone my mother has also moved in with me she you know as you get older shes starting to get little bit more dementia some people just stick their parents in home but i was good daughter i decided to take her into mind \\s therapist: so lots of changes lots of things going on yeah how do you feel like youre managing with all that \\s patient: i mean some days are obviously better or worse than others its been lot of changes like you said i mean im not getting enough sleep im things are tight financially \\s therapist: emotionally how have you been doing them managing things are \\s patient: you know sometimes very stressful like if my mother has an episode or when i get called from school but like i dont think im really like depressed or anything it just its kind of day to day thing \\s therapist: so there are ever any times that youre not managing well like youre not good at able to get out of bed or do things that you need to do in day \\s patient: theres couple mornings that i sleep in but its really like i still kind of get by i get everything done i need to like i know its kind of tough time right now but i dont feel like its gonna be hopeless forever hopefully \\s therapist: so some struggles but yeah okay do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol \\s patient: no i mean my mother used to drink but i tried to be really aware of not using that as crutch \\s therapist: so then no drinking at all at home \\s patient: no drinking i definitely dont want drugs in house for kids so none of either \\s therapist: what about making sure that sam your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things \\s patient: i im doing best i can you know like we havent gotten chance to get winter coat shopping yet his from last year still kind of it its not great but its solution for now \\s therapist: so hes wearing his coat from last year yeah do you have sense about that hard because of finances are there other reasons \\s patient: mostly finances but i mean kind of time too like to get everybody out door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping its big ordeal right i mean i know we didnt pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either it would be easier to add few extra dollars in few extra hours \\s therapist: right so sams not always having things that he needs right now then \\s patient: i guess not exactly no \\s therapist: yeah what about you know food or you deserve food in fridge are you able to put food on course \\s patient: i mean we have bulk foods were membership so when we do get out i let sam pick out things he likes to make you know macaroni stuff for sandwiches cereals that way you know sometimes he makes himself breakfast in morn before school or dinners \\s therapist: what kinds of things does sam have for dinner \\s patient: like i said like hell do macaroni you know sometimes its not great but ill do like fruit or you know sometimes some snack food sometimes more comprehensive meals i guess \\s therapist: i was what would you say he does he cooking or are you cooking or both \\s patient: i guess kind of mix of both to be honest like \\s therapist: so with all stress in house has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him \\s patient: not really i mean \\s therapist: what about how his discipline handled in your house has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt sam in any way \\s patient: no never i mean i used to give him timeouts when he was younger but \\s therapist: what about sexual abuse has anyone touched sam in sexual way or an inappropriate way excuse me yeah thats hard question to hear for lots of people but i asked everybody that question \\s patient: so no no never i i would never let that happen to my child okay \\s therapist: so so hes been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch okay so how do you think sams doing in his close family relationships do you think sams feeling loved supported \\s patient: i mean i know i guess i havent really been around for him as much as id like to be obviously i do best to let them know we know how much i care for him sometimes we have little bit more money i can get him something nice that he wants you know ive heard him kind of hes kind of thought that oh you love baby more than you love me but thats thats obviously not true i love both my kids \\s therapist: so what do you think he would say if he was here i asked him if he felt loved \\s patient: id hope hed say yes \\s therapist: theres some doubt \\s patient: i mean like i said like im \\s therapist: you mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom \\s patient: well shes lived with us for past year or so she was diagnosed with dementia so she has days where she remembers everything days where she started to slip more more she just shes very judgmental very opinionated she has way she likes things \\s therapist: has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in home \\s patient: no never \\s therapist: what about her relationship with you how she managing or how are you managing together with her in home \\s patient: some days are definitely better than others she like i guess you could say i kind of tried to check her behavior when she was getting little bit \\s therapist: has it ever come to physical blows between two of you \\s patient: no no just arguments here there \\s therapist: when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting \\s patient: like we raise our voices i mean its im doing best i can here \\s therapist: it ever its never come to physical blows \\s patient: no never id have to take some other action if that happened \\s therapist: that that that intensity that kind of like arguing or it like yelling screaming door slamming or people throwing objects \\s patient: i guess you could say weve gotten pretty loud i mean shell go kind of slam things in her room you know im i obviously i wouldnt ever let her hurt kids \\s therapist: where are sam baby when these things are happening \\s patient: sam will usually go hide in this room maybe turn this music up you know lees sometimes napping in crib in playpen i guess to be totally honest i do lose my patience scream more than id like to but \\s therapist: so it sounds like theres kind of lot of tension arguing in that relationship how often would you say that thats happening that it comes to that kind of arguing yelling place \\s patient: i guess like few times week \\s therapist: can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail \\s patient: no never \\s therapist: okay so thank you very much for sharing all of that im just going to recap sounds like theres been lot of stressors lots of change over last year yeah sam status moved away which kind of created some changes in finances which have led to maybe not always having food or clothing that youve needed or that sam has needed youve got your mom has moved in theres some stress tension arguing thats happening in that youve also told me that maybe all of these stressors stuff have contributed to sam not feeling as loved or as cared for on other hand it sounds like youre managing emotionally that youre not using any drugs or alcohol you have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical emotional or sexual abuse for sam his life that nobody in your family more in sams life has gone to prison so i think youre right there likely connection between kind of whats happening for sam in school difficulties that hes starting to have with all of these stresses changes at home so im going to book follow up appointment for you sam to come in at that time well talk about some of ways in which i might be able to help or develop plan together \\s patient: sounds sounds good thank you okay \\s therapist: all right so make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can okay \\s patient: you said you wanted to see sam for bit as well \\s therapist: yeah you gotta see sam right now then when when im done just make sure on way that you talk to reception about making another appointment okay all right exactly last all right okay thanks",
