            "therapist: good afternoon bruce . i glad you could make it in today . thanks for coming in . last week when you were you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana . and so we were working on way that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether . and how did you feel about our talk last week ? patient: it wa okay i guess . therapist: yeah . just okay . patient: yeah . therapist: all right . okay so i want to refresh your memory and i got my note here . do you mind if i refer to my note ? patient: okay therapist: yeah . patient: yeah i wa in the mood . therapist: i wondering what you could have done in the world . patient: i not sure what i could have done . therapist: and so because of the not exercising did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week ? patient: yeah it wa used a bit more . therapist: okay . okay . so how would you tie those two thing together by not running ? patient: i think the mix when i not exercising generally i would turn to the more usage . therapist: yeah yeah . so when you reflect back now on last week and the rain coming down and it wa cold i wondering if there wa a way that you could change your perception about that such that it would stop you from running . what do you think ? patient: yeah to change the perception above maybe wear a rain jacket or something . therapist: mm hmm that would be a great idea . that would be an excellent idea . patient: well i tried to stay away but i did . i still saw some of them . therapist: so it wa it wa difficult to cut them out of your life ? last week ? patient: yeah . therapist: and you tell me more but what wa difficult about it patient: the stuff that they think something badly of the i did want them to think you know avoiding the raising . therapist: so you did it sound like you did want to hurt their feeling . patient: yes therapist: by them thinking that you were going to avoid them . patient: yes therapist: and so a a result of this what what happened ? patient: well i just ended up going to see them and then hanging out . and yeah . therapist: so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana . is that correct ? patient: yeah . therapist: and i wondering how you could do that differently this week . patient: well i could i suppose i could just try hard enough to go and see you guy . therapist: and what would that involve trying harder not to go see them ? patient: hmm . therapist: yeah . sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment . yourself and just drawing the line . and do you have any friend that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with ? patient: yes i do i do feel that often but i could i could start to see that more . therapist: okay . how about motivated on a scale of one to ? would you say you are to kind of reignite friendship with people that do smoke pot ? patient: three . therapist: okay . so you still you still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friend again but i have to ask you bruce what do you what made you say three instead of one ? patient: well because i know for all so i feel like i need to i think i should start doing something about it . therapist: i think that great insight that you able to see that moving towards the friend that do smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly . and when you associated with the friend that did smoke pot in the past what kind of thing did you do ? patient: like what what kind of thing activity and thing ? therapist: yeah . wa it fun to be with them ? patient: yeah it wa fun . yeah we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activity maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing . usually it not so like you know there more . they tend to do more healthy activity i would say . therapist: so you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall without using the pot . patient: yeah you right there . it could be i might take my mind off of it . therapist: sometimes it good to remember having those good time with the friend that did smoke the pot because it make you realize that you do really need it . and i think that a great i think that a great idea . patient: wa i really had a lot of second thought . i wa worried about commitment and that kind of thing . so i did feel like that wa the right the right idea . therapist: okay so you had some second thought about that . you excited about it and last week session but after you had a chance to reflect upon it you kind of realized that it wa getting a dog wa not the best thanks for you patient: a lot of commitment and a lot of time that i just do have the motivation to be putting in . therapist: i think that wise to recognize that right up front i given the research on pet any kind of pet and how it help people sustained from alcohol and drug usage . i wondering if there is another option that you might consider . patient: maybe . what do you have in mind ? therapist: i thinking do you like pet that are do require such a commitment ? patient: that a good idea . i did think about that . therapist: because a dog is the dog is a large commitment . patient: yeah . you know there all kind of animal snake or fish or something . therapist: hey snake ! fish that would definitely be a star these animal that you like . patient: yeah . therapist: all right i think it important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to . alright so in the final goal wa to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana . how did you make out with that ? patient: i look into it . but like i went to the first the first meeting and i just felt like like those people were bought on the barrel and i wa just not i just did fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place . therapist: so you made the effort to go and you went patient: i could i just did want to stay . therapist: and so you did stay the whole time . patient: right . therapist: and so you left early because you felt you did feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you still higher functioning . patient: yeah therapist: i can definitely understand i wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you . what do you think ? patient: see there could be some positive . i just do i do i just do see it that much at this point . therapist: and what might be some positive that you would get out of the support group ? patient: well i would i would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation . and maybe it just a positive to be able to have connection with people like that . i not sure . therapist: so you you saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey and to have connection with other people . and again i can send you information that will show you that that just these two item alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot but from increasing the feel good hormone in your body the connection and the relating to other people . it might be similar when you were younger you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player . and so you had support that wa sort of like the team wa sort of like a support group . i wondering if you could relate to people in head connection and wondering if you could see a support group a a team . patient: yeah it would probably be the same kind of situation like essentially people in a support group are all there for the same goal . so it kind of like in hockey . very important there to win . mm hmm . therapist: and do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team ? patient: yeah it wa good . therapist: it gave . and that because of those good feeling hormone that come in neurotransmitter that come throughout your body when you have those connection . so how committed do you think you are ? if i were to send you a list of support group ? so you could try out some others ? where there were the bottom of the barrel ? a you say there ? how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week ? patient: probably eight or . yeah . therapist: wow . what made you say an eight rather than a four five wa just patient: a team analogy i think is a good analogy . therapist: so you thought how you remembered . you remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection ? patient: yeah . and also you know i do have to be the mean if if i think of it a a team maybe i would be like the star on the team because i not quite so bottom of the barrel . maybe therapist: i love that analogy . good thinking . it thinking bruce . that excellent . wow . well just to summarize today you came in you had made some progress but you had some stumbling block . you have decided that whether it rain or shine you going to run anyway because you going to have you raincoat and you going to embrace more of your positive friend rather than the friend that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it dog you going to look into getting a snake or what wa the other thing ? patient: oh fish . yeah . therapist: okay . and in term of a support group i will send you a list of support group . and you feel that on a scale of one to that you about an eight and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support group because of the hockey team analogy . great job . so overall how would you rate today session ? patient: it wa good very good . therapist: and if we were to put it on a scale of one to patient: eight therapist: out of eight . all right we did get in if we did an eight . patient: all right therapist: way to go . patient: thanks . therapist: all right . thanks",
            "the patient ha had a positive urine test analysis for marijuana . the therapist and patient were working on way to cut down or extinguish marijuana altogether . the patient did not exercise by running because it wa raining and this resulted in more usage of marijuana . on therapist nudge the patient agrees they could use a raincoat and ensure they go for running . they did not want to hurt their friend feeling and hence ended up hanging out with them and using marijuana . the patient rate three out of ten for motivation to meet friend who do use marijuana . the patient recall outdoor activity and healthy lifestyle with these friend . the therapist discus another option to take a pet and is left to patient to decide on the animal they can relate to . the therapist clarifies the postive effect of support group in improving abstinence and brings analogy with a hockey team a the patient play hockey . the patient rate eight on ten of attending a support group . the patient rate the therapy session a eight on ten ."

            "therapist: hello stone patient: yes . therapist: hi i pj daniel . sorry let me wash my hand . patient: call me dorothy . therapist: oh thank you . that the next thing i wa going to ask you . so dorothy the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what going on ? patient: five day ago i wa admitted to emergency . and they treated me by putting this tube down my throat . and i tried to to tell them and gesture at them that i do want this tube down my throat . and i just hope that never happens again . therapist: okay . no i totally understand that . i mean that is quite a scary thing to go through . and i think we do need to talk about this more and i glad that you asked it . talk to me about this . so i had a little bit of a look through your chart . i think i understand why they did it . but did anybody explain it to you ? patient: well not really . and because i wa gasping for air and in the state i wa but i tell you what i really worried that this wo happen to me again . i do want that to be anymore . i i okay to to pas this . therapist: absolutely . and you know what ? there no right answer when it come to deciding on thing that are aggressive like the two we really want to know what the patient value in term of you know thing that are that invasive and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want . but i do need to find out a little bit more about you in term of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital . patient: well i have congested part failure . and i guess there wa water in my lung and stopping me from breathing properly . so i wa living in my soul the ambulance brought me in to the emergency . so they that wa how they were treating me . therapist: so you pretty much showed up to emergency . and very quickly they put that tube down . patient: that correct . therapist: did anybody ask you if you were okay with that ? patient: well i tried to gesture to them that i do want the tube but therapist: they did quite pick up on that . patient: i guess not . and you know i had that three time already . i do want to go through with therapist: the two you had . patient: yes . i do want it anymore . therapist: okay . and so so you have congestive heart failure and it sound like you got a breathing problem . yes . and do you know why they would have put the tube down . do you know what they were trying to do ? patient: i guess because i wa short of air . i had a hard time breathing right ? so they tried to like i going to use the word save me . therapist: right . so it sound like you understand that . i mean usually we only put a tube in . if that wa the only thing we could do to save you . most of the time of congestive heart failure . we give some medication . have you heard of lasix ? or furosemide ? no okay . it a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure but if someone is really sick and then we do think we have time to give it that the time we would think of a breathing tube . have had a chance to look through the chart but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in . patient: i i guess so . but i okay with dying . okay . you know like i say i lived a good life and if it if the good lord say that it my time i okay with that . and you would put it to therapist: no my know already what i hearing from you . exactly . i just gon na say exactly what you said sound like you lived a good life . you been through this a few time you know exactly what it involves . and if i could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage . is that correct ? patient: that is correct . and but you know what doctor ? how can i be assured that my wish are respected so i do get this tube down ? therapist: that an excellent question . so first i did want to answer your previous question based on what we talking about . absolutely . i agree with you that it is your wish and we will respect that wish that we not going to put a breathing tube down again . and then of course your second question which is great a well a how do we make sure this doe happen ? so what i going to do after our conversation and i do have a few more question to ask you but after conversation i write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too . and your reason for why you do want it which of course make sense to me . and then what i do is i document a short form called goal of care . and i just so it a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two second i know exactly what you want we will give you a copy of that to take home . but i find that not usually enough . what we also do what i do is i tend to when you leave hospital dictate a note to your family doctor . and that note actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in alberta . and in that note will very clearly state you and i have this conversation and you really did want the breathing to so i reassure you we do everything we can to make sure people understand you do want that to okay . patient: all thank you . i i wa so concerned about that and yes i i think i will rest now because like i say that wa a horrendous experience . and he say it wo happen again . therapist: okay . i do want to ask you just a few other question related to this . go ahead . and the first question might sound a little off putting but i sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want . we do have to ask how wa your mood ? how are you feeling ? patient: i i feeling fine . my mood is fine . i have no no problem . therapist: okay excellent . and how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital ? like when you healthy a healthy a you can be ? say a few week ago ? patient: i think i am enjoying life . okay . yes i am enjoying life to the to the best i can . therapist: okay great . yeah . and then other related question we did talk about the two that we would put it in . but again we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want . okay ? so if we had to give you medication to get your breathing better is that something you be willing to have ? patient: certainly oh yes . oh look at medication just not the intubation . therapist: okay . and then usually along the line with the intubation when people do want the intubation we often also want to know if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck you would pas away or if someone just found you at home who had passed away . would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shock trying to bring you back to life ? patient: no no no i like i said the good lord know when it my time . therapist: no and that make sense to me with no breathing . patient: yes and i have no problem with that . therapist: there are some other thing we can do . that not a breathing tube but they a little aggressive . and one is have you ever heard of bipap ? patient: i do think so . therapist: it a mass that really push air into you . it a little uncomfortable but nothing a bad a a breathing tube . maybe hard to answer this question because you do know what that is . but to have any thought on that if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask and we would do it just a long a you were okay with it and comfortable at the time patient: would it be for a long time ? therapist: now usually most time with bipap ? it only about two to six hour for most patient . patient: yeah that would be okay with me . okay . and if therapist: we had to put large iv and line into your wrist and stuff and take you to the intensive care unit . again we would do breathing too but this is just to watch you closely . patient: yeah i would be okay with that . yes yes . it doe sound invasive to me . therapist: okay . patient: no i just needed to be reassured that that it wo happen again . and and yeah i i know that on my chart . it there . yes yes . and that all i need to hear because i wa concerned . okay . therapist: i do want to say that this is not set in stone in the sense that if you ever change your mind we can have the conversation again . but if we do hear from you this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart . i just want you to know that in case anything were to change patient: okay . so if i change my mind i can i will talk to you . therapist: absolutely . patient: i do think i change . therapist: i do think you will either . but it just nice to see that you aware of that . okay . um honestly i mean there some other question . i tend to ask people when i do know them . well just kind of routine stuff . okay . and maybe we just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure anything else ? patient: um that it . i beginning with an as but i ca remember what it is . therapist: okay that okay . we can usually we have it written down . yeah your medication . i think i saw you on aspirin and two jock and i think two others . do you happen to know or have them written down ? patient: you do want i always carry this paper with me because i ca remember the name . so okay . therapist: oh so you are on the water pill ? the furosemide . okay patient: yes . therapist: and . okay great . yeah . um any allergy ? patient: no . therapist: okay . and i wo ask but anything that run in your family given your age they told me you is that correct ? patient: that is correct . therapist: yes . and i do have to ask the following question completely unrelated to what we talking about . that okay . do you smoke at all ? patient: no i do therapist: drink any alcohol . patient: no no . therapist: okay . and this will be sound crazy but i have to ask any street drug illegal drug anything like that ? patient: no i never had the opportunity therapist: to test any over the counter herbal in addition to these . patient: no i do take any of those . therapist: and where are you living right now . patient: i living in a convalescent home for the last six month . i used to live in my own home . and six month ago i moved to a convalescent home . therapist: okay . and how do you feel about that ? that changed six month ago . patient: i would really prefer my own home . but just trouble with my breathing sometimes right ? therapist: so you feeling better about being in that place now ? a new home patient: it okay . okay i really have to adjust . like i say if i had my druthers i go back but i guess i have to learn to adjust to this right . okay . therapist: so i think i sort of have all the information i need to make sure that your wish are respected . just one last time . anything else you want to talk about today ? patient: oh you answered my question . i wa so worried about this tube . therapist: okay . all right . well it very nice to meet you and stone . patient: thank you .",
            "the patient wa admitted five day ago for an emergency . the patient wa treated by putting a tube down their throat . the patient doe not want the tube down their throat every again . the patient ha a congested part failure . they had water in their lung and stopped them from breathing properly hence they showed up to emergency . the patient ha had tube down their throat three time already . the therapist clarifies that wa the only to thing to save the patient but the patient argues that the quality of life is important more than quantity . the therapist explains making a document called goal of care which will be available to any doctor who is going to treat the patient . the patient answer that their mood is fine they prefer to have medication just not the intubation nor shock to bring them up . the patient is okay with bipap . they patient ha only heart failure a medical history . the patient is on aspirin two jock and the water pill fursemide . the patient is aged doe not drink or use drug doe not use over the counter herbal . six month ago they moved into a convalescent home . the therapist assures that the patient wish will be respected ."

went out like hamburger french fry candy you know stopped in wah wah on the way up . it disgusting . i ca i did want to tell you how because it disgusting and the clothes are fitting . it just really really sad . therapist: you had a rough week ? patient: yeah . therapist: so let talk about for a second . i like to the kind of your relationship to this problem . how do you how do you view this problem ? patient: it disgusting . it like it slavery . food owns me . therapist: so the so the food is in control of this situation ? patient: sound ridiculous when you say it like that but that what it is . therapist: it in control ? patient: yeah therapist: alright . so now i want to ask you a couple of question about the importance and the confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or we would be be here . patient: oh my god i would love to yeah . therapist: so if you looking at a scale of one to one wa it not important to change and wa extremely important change . this is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating time very important to you . patient: yeah it very important therapist: very important . okay . so what if i asked the same question except this time ? you confidence . so one is you not confident all you can change but you very confident you could change . patient: i could probably change for half a day . i done it . and sometimes if i lucky i get a week . but overall ? therapist: overall yeah patient: it impossible . like you want a number at zero . therapist: so it below the below the scale of one to this is patient: yeah therapist: so you can have no confidence at all . patient: i tried it . i know . i mean it like beating my head against the wall . therapist: so on one hand you like to you like to stop the eating it important to but on the other hand you do believe you can do it . patient: i ca do it . therapist: you ca do it ? patient: i ca . therapist: it ca be done . have there been any other change you have been able to make say in the last few year that have been positive . patient: i stopped biting my nail . therapist: so you had some small success in term of making change . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: what do you think make the this thought i just refer to a the food problem so much more powerful ? so much more difficult to tackle ? patient: i wish i know . i mean there so many thing it it everywhere . therapist: the food is everywhere ? patient: it is everywhere . i mean therapist: you mentioned before that brownie were the culprit for this last week . patient: brownie hershey bar hershey kiss yeah chocolate . therapist: you enjoy chocolate ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . how about other food that could be contributing the problem ? maybe you do enjoy a much a chocolate . patient: oh potato chip . french fry . mexican food . what else ? cheese ? therapist: definitely any of the type of candy ? patient: start naming skittle cherry starburst basically any candy . therapist: pretty much any candy ? patient: yeah . therapist: so of the candy so i want to focus just on the candy . okay and not to the food just for now . the thought of like i introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate . how would you react to that ? patient: not gon na happen . therapist: that not gon na happen ? all right patient: i would love for it to happen . therapist: right but that not gon na happen ? patient: i can just tell you i do even want to pretend . therapist: so you know that for sure . how about the let let go for example with the skittle . what if i introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of skittle ? patient: just the candy skittle ? therapist: just just that one candy . yeah . patient: why bother that ? like can i not eat skittle ? is that what you saying ? like therapist: you could . it up to you whether or not but if i introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of skittle how would you react to that ? patient: i do really understand why . therapist: well it represents a change in the direction that you want to move . patient: but if i stopped eating skittle i still going to eat brownie i still going to eat . yeah therapist: we know we know that scenario that you know you ca really make a change right now from what you saying . like that the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well with you patient: no it not gon na happen . therapist: and that fine . but the idea of stopping skittle patient: it fine . therapist: that doe seem a daunting ? patient: no . therapist: would you agree still on say the scale that it important to stop skittle ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . patient: yeah . therapist: how confident are you you could not eat ? patient: it kind of funny now you talking about it i sort of want skittle more . but you know i like from now till next week when i come in here i say like i am confident i could not eat skittle and it would not be a major problem . therapist: so this is a change that you think you could accomplish . patient: yeah therapist: even though you not sure it actually contribute to solving the larger problem . we know that that something that that an area where you do really see a change a a likely patient: if i do eat skittle this week or even for the rest of my life is it going to solve my problem ? no but will i do it ? if that what you want me to do ? yeah that fine . therapist: well i would hope it something that that you would want to do . i mean what i want is one thing what you want is really important here . is this something that mean your skittle part of the problem ? patient: yeah therapist: small ? patient: yeah therapist: alrigh . no pun intended right . but it a small part of the problem but you agree it still part of the problem . patient: yeah sure . therapist: not a huge change . but it one that we can work on . patient: alright therapist: and we want you to be able to you know genuinely buy into the goal . i mean if you do think it important we can talk about other area of change . patient: no i guess i see what you saying . i mean if i gon na be completely honest with you i well that what i paying you for . right ? so i do think it gon na work . i just tell you that therapist: right . you think you could stop eating skittle but you do think it gon na solve the larger problem or lead to ? patient: exactly . therapist: but that what we have to work with right now . because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it ha control . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: so if i introduced the idea of stopping brownie patient: no no no sorry . therapist: so let let go after the change that we can achieve in this case . you know it not perfect . it not ideal but it what you can do . you saw the plan so suffer so for this week so you can week for this week just just continue eating skittle . patient: now skittle alright therapist: and let see let see how we do with that change . patient: so that seemed to make sense . therapist: yeah . patient: so work with that and i see you again week . therapist: thanks . patient: thank you",

            "therapist: okay charles let take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule . patient: not very much on it . therapist: i take a look at it and see well you did complete most of it . patient: i do see the point . and i mean how do you master watching tv or eating a meal ? i if i had tried to use chopstick i suppose it would have some mastery involved in but i i did mess with chopstick okay . food wa okay . hmm . but not not great . okay . therapist: so it wa tough . and i just want to be clear though charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with . it very difficult to complete homework worksheet because thing happen right ? i do feel that well sometimes thing get in the way . there thing that just prevent me from doing that . so i think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barrier that make these sort of thing difficult . so what would you say what would be some barrier that made it difficult to your mastery rating . patient: i do enjoy anything . and i used to i used to enjoy it a lot of thing . but i do even i do look forward to breakfast particularly cup of coffee . the news is mostly bad and what if there is news ? i mean the paper doe carry much national news anymore . so i mean i have to eat but i really do see the point of a lot of thing . therapist: okay . okay . well i think something that will be useful for both of u charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these thing . versus the con . so there a worksheet that i have called a decisional balance worksheet . and it basically take two separate decision . one decision is to engage in activity and there some benefit to doing that . and then another decision would be to not engage in activity . there benefit to that . but there also cost to both of those decision . so i think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of thing you could do and determine whether there more benefit or cost to completing that ? what do you think about that ? patient: well that would depend on the activity . i know but okay . i could i could get in touch with somebody i could call a friend . maybe try to meet somebody for lunch . therapist: okay that a great idea . so what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch ? patient: well i would i would enjoy the company . okay and would be a lonely i suppose . therapist: okay that sound great . so sound like one benefit would be you enjoy the company . yeah . and you would be a lonely . so i write that down . okay good . patient: company company and said not a lonely not only . that good okay . therapist: okay can you think of the downside to potentially doing that ? patient: well one downside might be that he would be interested in having lunch with me . i have been a whole lot of fun lately . and or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch . therapist: okay or patient: he might want to talk about what going on in my life and i ready we do want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course . okay . therapist: so it sound like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy . patient: right ? that could be the downside . is that right ? okay . might not be able to come . sure . therapist: okay . so i write that is a great job charles with the top two box with the first decision . so let move to the second decision which would be to stay the same and there some benefit to that and there some cost to that a well . sure . okay charles so we completed the worksheet . so what your overall impression about the benefit of changing versus the con and staying the same ? patient: well it make sure that the the benefit outweigh the con . if if i make the change if i do make the change i be doing just what i been doing and i be getting up wondering what the point ? and well still be lonely . and therapist: those are good observation charles . so which activity doe make the most sense to try for homework this week ? patient: well i call somebody i think okay . therapist: okay that a good observation . so let say for homework then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend . and how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule and completing both the mastery and the pleasure rating ? what do you think about that ? patient: sure . okay . therapist: okay . and if it get difficult which again that pretty normal for that to take place . if it get hard we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barrier . doe that sound good ? patient: sure . okay okay .",
            "the therapist discus patient last week homework schedule . the patient is disinterested to carry out the activity . the therapist explains that it is a decisional balance worksheet and request to weigh pro and con for each activity . the patient feel calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch sound exciting and would be a lonely . the therapist highlight the practical downside to that maybe the person is busy and not able to come from the response from patient . the patient agrees the con of staying the same will not change anything and they will feel lonely . the therapist encourages to meet someone a a homework and asks to try out a full day activity schedule . the therapist aknowledges it will be hard and the problem can be addressed in next session ."

            "therapist: hi ann how are you doing today ? patient: i am okay how are you dr . grande ? therapist: i am good thanks for asking what been going on ? patient: not really a lot of change on the drug front . therapist: mm hmm patient: it a you know the the adderall i really struggling . therapist: still struggling with the adderall ? . patient: yeah . i not sure what to do because i know that i mean i having such a hard time with it . but when i do have it i am . i just not functioning i not able to get a much accomplished therapist: right so go ahead patient: well it it like it always there to . therapist: it always available ? patient: it always available yeah . or so much at the time . therapist: you having some mixed feeling about it . so i sensing . patient: yeah . yeah . like i know i want to stop therapist: you think you think you want to stop ? patient: yeah . no i do . therapist: you do ? patient: oh my god see i feel crazy but i know it would be good if i did have it in my life . therapist: but at the same time it is in your life ? patient: and i do know how to get out of that . i mean the one thing if i did live with my roommate that would be one thing . like it would be in the apartment all the time . therapist: so you find you have easier access to the adderall when you when you in the house or apartment with your with your roommate . patient: yeah . therapist: so if you physically were there like with your roommate in that apartment ? patient: yeah like if i wa oh my god living at home with my parent again or even living with somebody else i guess . oh my god move ? what a hassle but that i mean that the problem . it just there . it it accessible . therapist: so you kind of it sound like you recognizing that maybe you do have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it right there in front of you . patient: maybe you right . yeah that that good . because before i did really want to stop at some i mean i definitely sometimes i want to stop i my mind i go back and forth . you know but for the most part i would like to be without it . you know i really do want to deal with this anymore . therapist: so mostly so so there still some feeling for you . you want to use it but mostly you would like to stop ? patient: well it make u so easy to get stuff done . i mean i just take a couple and boom boom boom i mean therapist: so there some advantage for you ? patient: yeah definitely . definitely . and i so used to it . so it just comfortable and therapist: it comfortable and it allows you to be productive . are there any downside to it ? patient: well yeah . when i do have it the crash it like a really bad crash and i not productive . you know it it and it gotten worse than it used to be . like i need it . therapist: so it painful ? patient: it painful . definitely . definitely . it feel like a trap . i want out . therapist: and one of the idea you having wa sound like potentially wa moving out moving out of the apartment because then you would have access to the who would have access to the adderall anymore ? or it would be hard to get ? patient: oh my god like sometimes it really weird . sometimes it feel like that a good idea . and then sometimes i like no no i do want to be you know kind of cut off from it but i think i am come ready . therapist: you think you ready for that ? patient: yeah therapist: and that moving out you really see is what you would need to do . because stopping while living there is too difficult . patient: yeah yep i think you right . therapist: remember before you tried to stop living there a few time right or or last few month and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that give it to you . it just appears that temptation so great for you . patient: yeah she really doe get it . she doe understand like what ? what a problem this is for me ? she definitely not supporting me or anything like that . yeah god maybe it would be better therapist: well are there any disadvantage to living with your parent ? patient: living with my parent at my age it just feel like a little bit humiliating a lot humiliating . therapist: okay so humiliation would be one . patient: yeah just this feeling of failure embarrassment and then my mom just is in my business . therapist: so some clear disadvantage to move into paris any advantage other than the obvious who would separate you from the adderall ? patient: am i would you buy laundry ? fully stocked fridge ? therapist: yeah . patient: yeah my dad will fill my gas tank up . therapist: thing that happened before ? patient: uh huh . therapist: so there some disadvantage to this plan but there some advantage . and there a key advantage of being think of narrow . patient: yeah . and it would necessarily have to be the rest of my life either . just for now just to get me out of that apartment with the drug . right ? therapist: that would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on . patient: oh my god do i want to i mean that that just it . like it like it sound really good until i like really think about it . therapist: when you really think about it what come to mind ? patient: oh like i start to shake like that feeling of you know when you really want something you really want something and you ca get to it . and that desperation that i like right now i know that you know i living there it could be my choice . i could take it or i could not take it . you know but at least when i want it it there . if i move out i like making that decision for myself . therapist: that right . it would be . patient: i do know . therapist: is it tough ? patient: yeah therapist: before it seemed like you really more on the side of making this change than not . clearly there still some thing you want to consider . patient: no you know you right though . i want out and it not really a choice when i there . like i say i have the choice yes or no but the choice is always yes . therapist: you always end up using the adderall ? patient: yeah . therapist: so so make sure i understand the situation overall . you live with your roommate she ha that role and she make it available to you use it ? patient: yeah therapist: you tried to stop that behavior but that just not working for you . patient: yeah yeah that so clear . and i do want to be using it . therapist: you do want to be using it . but yet you are . especially because the proximity right like cuz you right there and she ha it and it just tougher to stop that behavior . there another possible decision which is moving back home which ha some disadvantage and advantage . patient: yeah that true . it would be nice having that fully stocked fridge . therapist: so that there an upside to it . patient: yeah therapist: that would be beyond just not using the drug which would which fit itself it be a big victory for you . patient: yeah . and my mom would be there to talk to yeah . yeah . therapist: so let do this . it seems like that the direction you moving . right ? patient: okay . therapist: no pun intended with moving . but that you you you thinking that might be a better way to go ? patient: yeah . therapist: so for the next session let plan out that and this would necessarily be doing anything . this would just be let plan out the step that you have to put in place to move out to move back home talking to your parent whatever financial arrangement have the roommate getting all your stuff out the logistics of moving let just go through the step . patient: okay . therapist: and try to get a firm plan together . and of course you can always re evaluate and change your mind . patient: okay right . therapist: but all we doing at this point is just just planning and seeing how it would look . patient: this is kind of exciting . therapist: exciting ? patient: yeah it definitely is . i can do that . therapist: so i will see you and next week ? patient: okay therapist: and we pick up where we left off and we we start with a planning and we see what happens with that . patient: cool . all right . therapist: thanks .",

patient: they made me but i do like it . because i know the way we need to do thing . if we given a project okay ? it start with a b c d and then no everybody want oh let do c o d and then f . no no no no a b c d there is no deviation from that . and then they get mad at me . therapist: so working in group ha worked out too well for you . patient: not really not le . people listen to me . therapist: so in instance where people listen to how have thing worked out patient: if i oversee everything i still get on uncomfortable because you know they out of my sight . i do know what they doing . sometimes you know i have to watch person you know one person other person over there . i do know what they doing . and if it not done right it not done right . and that bad . therapist: can you tell me anything about sure . mood in general in term of have you felt sad or anxious or anything like that recently ? patient: no particular i get i guess i feel anxious sometimes when thing are going the way they need to go . because then it put off the whole day . and that doe i guess i would i would consider that you know anxiety because if it not going the right way one thing go wrong the whole day is thrown off . and then now i have to deal with that . now i have to adjust my whole schedule environment and that ha caused me anxiety even by men even by a minute therapist: so if you if your day is not going the way you planned for it to go you feeling some anxiety from that . absolutely . no . doe your employer ever have like unscheduled meeting or anything like that that happens patient: that he doe he will schedule some some unscheduled meeting . and i i commonly i tried to call me approach him and say you know there a meeting we need to know about it . you know i need to schedule my day around the meeting . he want scheduled meeting at . and i told him i at lunch to . why do you think that appropriate ? i mean sometimes i feel like i the only smart person there and the only person who know how this need to run . therapist: she ha some different stressor at work . patient: i presume sort of my home like burying meat you know if you go into my home everything nice . everything where it need to be . i have my meal scheduled out i have a nice little calendar . everything you know planned you know thursday chicken friday tamale and so on and so forth . therapist: so your home life a bit like your work life in term of being organized . patient: that the right way to do it . therapist: do you ever in term of your home life ever collect anything ? patient: yeah i do . therapist: do keep them in your home . patient: receipt receipt ? well it say to keep it . i mean i always known you have to keep receipt . you do know when you ever going to have to prove that you purchase something or when you have to return something . therapist: so what percentage of the receipt that you given do you think that you keep all of them patient: every single one i get very upset if i do me if i go to mcdonald or food fast food place i want everything . i therapist: gon na ask you some some question . boom come back to work kind of regarding your work schedule . patient: i wash my hand before eat after i eat therapist: do you ever find yourself like having washed your hand and then going back and washing them several other time ? patient: no there there no need to do that . nobody do that . no you wash your hand second . that it . that all you need to do . therapist: do you have any particular concern about germ or anything like that ? patient: i try to keep me but i do particularly know . therapist: have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly like a doorknob or operating a light switch ? seems to lower your anxiety like repeatedly doing that ? patient: not at all . now that seems like a waste of time . therapist: that that be inefficient . patient: yeah yeah there no need to do that . how about therapist: double checking for example light switch or to make sure the door are locked . i made patient: sure my door are locked . the first time okay therapist: so check but just the one time patient: well i do it . well you know when i come in the door lock the door . that it . okay . therapist: so what do you think the solution here is your your employer sent you in for counseling . like the change patient: he want me to be more flexible to not get a upset if there is an unscheduled meeting if somebody say switch shift with me . i do really understand it but i in trouble at work . so i have to look into what therapist: you like your job . patient: i do like my job . i like being able to have everything i need you know somebody call for something you know oh it right here . somebody call somebody else right here . i love it . it like a machine . therapist: right ? so you like your job you like how you able to be organized there . but there some conflict with co worker and your bos you want to you want to try to work that out . patient: i guess i mean i do want to lose my job . and if this is a problem the right thing to do would be to come speak to you therapist: not to open to attending counseling session and take a look at what going on here . patient: absolutely if my bos requires that my bos requires that then that the right thing to do . therapist: i want to appreciate you answering my question and spin very helpful . we get you on the schedule to see a counselor here . i take about a week and we go from there . patient: okay so in a week . all right . thank you . therapist: thanks .",

patient: yeah yeah cuz i do know what to do . therapist: what i want to reassure you of is that i not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all . i here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what going on and what if anything you like to do differently . so this is really up to you . what you would like to explore today how doe that sound ? patient: that sound really hard because i not sure i very good at sorting thing out myself . yeah . yeah . therapist: so right now you feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that going on and you not even sure where to start . patient: yeah that a good way to put it . i kind of confused about what to do next . and i have a little baby at home so i do i ca think anyway most the time . therapist: yeah . so now anything any kind of decision you make or anything that you do affect both you and and the baby . patient: mm hmm . and and my boyfriend affect him . which is why i guess i guess i here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we you know how we work together . therapist: well i if you interested or you willing why do you tell me a little bit about your story ? patient: i do know where to start . he and i had been together for about a year . and i got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago . and and before that i wa working . and he and i you know we on and off here and there we get invite and he disappears for a while then he come back . that kind of what the ear look like . and i just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that did even look like him . he looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out . and quite honestly it freaked him out too . he did he said he did know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control . therapist: so the in the history of the relationship over this year it kind of been in and out in a way and there have been some incident where you had some argument and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it doe sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out . all all of you the baby and you and him and and wa kind of scary . patient: mm hmm . yeah he came home . i wa a friend come over a man friend he doe like me to have men friend came over to help me with my resume because i starting to think about going back to work . and he had a weird look in his eye and so i kind of you know we sped up and i kind of let my friend leave but soon a after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it wa just different than anything that ever happened to me or u together and he just got this weird kind of like he wa possessed by something . and he said he did he would never do that again . he he really good daddy . and he really help u out a lot . therapist: so in a way it doe it did even really make sense to you or to him because on the one hand he really good . good with you and good with the father . i mean good with your child . and on the other hand it wa just like what is this something really different ? patient: yeah . yeah . and he he he really help u out . and i did know what to do with that . so that why it i guess that feeling that i have had since that happened ha prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do . therapist: what are your thought right now about some of the option out there for you to do if if anything what are what are you thinking about ? patient: i have talked anybody for for a year really therapist: gotten pretty isolated ? patient: yeah . yeah i have my parent live pretty far away and and i guess he kind of a boyfriend kind ofi guess the word jealous . he just really care about u . and so i have had a chance to really talk to people about what some idea would be that will . what could i do i used to work and i wa kind of looking forward to working again . he he sort of made it clear that i do need to work because he going to take care of u he brings home diaper and give u some money when he around and so we really do need it most the time . therapist: so you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and and yet he he doe really he expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you . and and when he there he doe take care of you . patient: yeah yeah . yeah it doe take care of u . he uh he he make sure that i have enough money for you know the basic need in the house and he pay the rent and and you know but when i when he gone and i run out of money it just kind of that when i think cut it . just wish i could take a little bit by myself . i just not sure how to go about doing that . therapist: doe that leaf you in a real bind when you you there and you do have what you need ? patient: and i yeah and i do know who to talk to about that . i try to call him sometimes and make up you know and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that work and sometimes it doe . therapist: so you kind of find yourself when you in that bind trying to find way of of getting getting what you need . patient: yeah . yeah . so i do know how to do this . i mean i do know what to do next . not very good at it . therapist: i just want to say we can go over some thing that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you . but i just want to let you know that this is i really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it . and it it not an easy situation and you definitely not alone . and i really appreciate your willingness to talk about it . patient: thanks . it really hard to therapist: yeah i know . there are lot of different thing that we can talk about that are that that many woman in very similar situation find themselves and thing that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be ? patient: okay therapist: and and some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship you mentioned a few thing about your your relationship and how it kind of go in and out and it can be really good and and then he can be gone for a while and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that . we can certainly talk about resource about the resource in the community that may be there for you or in term of your own understanding . but also if you if you are in need of additional help we can talk about those . we can talk about safety planning . i mean one of the one of the important thing is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe . and we can talk about that . we can talk about finance . you mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now . we can certainly for that a little bit more taking care of yourself which patient: yeah right . therapist: yeah yeah for many many new new mom that hard under any circumstance to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy . so that certainly something we can talk about . and also just the whole issue about taking care of your child and and your your mothering your parenting how you might how you might focus on that and in this situation or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front . just to start with what do you think ? patient: well it it funny a you showing me this i i been thinking all i been doing is focusing on the baby and being a good mom and and and yet i also trying to think about getting a job and i do know how those two fit together . and even a i just saying that out loud . i not even talking about taking care of him . which is weird that i not even when i look at this these circle i am looking at mothering and child and finance and that seems to be important yet i spent i spend so much time thinking about him all the time and right now i not therapist: so maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it mean and where it is . and now you kind of think well maybe i think about some other thing and see where i might go with those . patient: these thing if the job and taking learning how to be a better mother and might be a might help the relationship so that might be therapist: so might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you taking care of your child that those thing might help you um free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship ? patient: what to do about the relationship ? yeah what to do about the relationship ? i not sure what to do with a relationship . therapist: yeah . you know you the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what when the timing is right for any decision that you make one way or the other . patient: i do even know what to think about that . i do know how to . yeah i do feel like i been making any decision . therapist: yeah . well and it sound like you like to think about making some decision in other area . and and when you think about that is that right ? would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job ? if that something you like to talk about ? patient: yeah . and how to balance that with being a mom at the same time because that sound really hard . therapist: well you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby wa born what what thought do you have about how you might go about balancing that ? and and in thinking about thinking about that what have you thought about ? patient: well i guess i think initially that i would need his help more he would need to help take care of the baby . he doe do that . now . so i do know . and it be kind of scary that i do know what that would look like . so i would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even just part time so i could get some childcare or something . yeah . therapist: so you might have to explore some other option for the child care and in other way of taking care of the baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work ? patient: yeah . yeah . somebody i trusted . yeah . and i have to figure out just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where i could still breastfeed and help her with her nap and make sure i there for bedtime and all those important time but make enough money that it wa worthwhile to to do it . yeah to be out and working and paying somebody . that sound like a lot . therapist: it really doe sound though like you you really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and and and thing the basic need and really taking care of your child at the same time . patient: umm mm hmm . it very important to me . i did i did think i wa i wanted to have child . and then we did so . i would like him to be a daddy in that . wow . just well a i wa thinking about him not being around a the daddy and i not really sure what to do with that . but the baby the baby is the most important thing right now . therapist: right patient: i did realize that i spent so much time thinking about him all the time . and when we can hear back and doe he love u ? and why the heck did he do that that weird thing and why doe he care about these other thing that he care about ? therapist: like being jealous not wanting you to have friend ? patient: yeah why doe he . and it ha nothing to do with what i thinking about now which is the baby and therapist: but it we mentioned that a couple time now that it that it sort of surprise you the way you thinking about it in the way you approaching it . like you recognizing we seeing that you spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and and why thing are happening in the relationship or what it really mean you spent a lot of time there . that kind of surprise you that you might be thinking about it differently patient: agonizing i guess that what i been doing . i feel like i just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always so when the baby cry and i worrying about him and and and so the baby cry is just it hard but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feel kind of freeing that i could actually think about why the baby cry a opposed to why why is he not returning my call ? or why did he give me that look when i you know talked about getting a job and thing like that it not so interesting . therapist: so you realizing to how much it really take to focus attention on on the baby . and to be able to do it and it like i it hard to do both . it hard to really think about doing both . patient: i need his help with that . yeah i do need to be worrying about him too . therapist: hmm patient: i do understand what safety planning mean . therapist: well one of the thing that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen or you know and i know you said he had indicated that he would do it again . but sometimes it really help people to feel to have some plan in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe if that what need to happen . patient: so if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again which actually i seen before but he just never really did anything like this before . therapist: he just went farther this time ? patient: yeah . okay so like if i recognize if i saw that look what to do ? therapist: yeah yeah . and and and sometimes that tie in with you know there might be place that you can go to get saved there might be step that you can take to to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby safe for people to call or think just thing that you can do based on what your life is like and what you what resource you have available to you . is that something you interested in really exploring ? patient: sound kind of freaky to think that i would have to keep myself safe from somebody that say he love me and you know love the baby . sound a little strange . therapist: some way it just seems like it should have to be that way . patient: no should have to be that way . but i did expect him to do what he did either . so that kind of came out of nowhere therapist: really took you by surprise . it something that you just trying to figure out where how doe this fit and what it what doe it mean ? and what do i do with it ? what what how do i how do i respond to this ? patient: yeah it doe seem real . so i guess thinking about thinking about that kind of make sense ahead of time . therapist: yeah . well let me see if i if i got it all and then we can make some decision about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that . i want to make sure i understand a little bit about your situation . patient: okay therapist: and this first of all this is the first time you come in . this is the first time that you had something that really happened this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some step because it scared you and you you are wanting to protect yourself and your baby . you really want to protect the baby you have this relationship that been cut off and on and but he been very supportive and helpful in term of giving you meeting your basic need and the baby basic need and want to take care of you and and there are time when it really good . and there are time when you been le sure and this is this incident ha also made you to kind of think about that some of the way that you been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprise you but you looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit so that you can have more financial independence if you will or be able to take care of yourself at the for those time when you need to . and you starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe . did i kind of get it all patient: that yeah that kind of capture it all . yes . yeah . i do know . i do know where to start . but i guess that why i talking to you . therapist: yeah . yeah . so maybe we can we can take that next step in and when when when we get together again and we can do that we can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those area for keeping yourself safe and and for you know looking at the possibility because there are option and resource out there should you choose to make the decision to go back to work there are some option for you . patient: so there like a good somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that . therapist: there are other option for for a variety of thing and we can make some have some discussion about that . patient: okay . okay . doe that sound that sound good . okay nice . therapist: well i really appreciate again you coming in today and we will follow up with this conversation and in it you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decision that you need and again they are your decision about what if anything you want to change and what your next step is . patient: thank you . i think i go get my baby from childcare and well should we make another appointment or something ? therapist: yes let make another appointment . patient: okay . thank you .",

            "therapist: how are you doing today ? patient: good . therapist: what been going on ? patient: been a little anxious about a shopping habit that i have therapist: talk about that ? patient: yes well i have to buy everything in pair or in two . and if i only have one thing i wo buy it i put it back or i look around the store for another thing so that i have two thing to buy . y therapist: so when you go into store if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy a second item or even more just second patient: sometimes it can be more a long a it reached the minimum of two . therapist: so you have to leave having purchased a minimum of two right ? or if you ca find something else you wo buy it at all . exactly . so so zero would also be acceptable . patient: zero would be acceptable . therapist: but one patient: no no no i ca do just one guy ca do one . okay . now it got to be two or more . therapist: and what happens that ha ever been the occasion where you only purchased one thing ? patient: i ca really remember one . i sure there ha been but i ca really remember one . therapist: so for all this period of time you have successfully either purchase nothing or two or more item . patient: oh yeah . i have to it very anxiety producing if i do know therapist: how anxiety producing patient: it i just feel like something bad will happen . if i do keep it to two or more . therapist: you know what would happen ? give a specific . patient: well for example like my family would be in a car accident or i would hit deer or you know get fired from my job . therapist: so something really really bad will happen . this is hurtful for you . this is causing you pain . patient: yes . therapist: and this would happen . this would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing you be reminded so if you went in wanting more than one thing it not a problem right ? patient: it if i only really need one thing and then i ca just buy that one thing that i need . therapist: alright so how often doe this happen ? where you are in a situation where you want to make a purchase of just one item ? and you have to you have to change because the anxiety patient: daily therapist: daily ? patient: yeah because i mean if i go grocery shopping or if i go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing you know which i would encounter daily pretty much it happens therapist: i would like fill up your car gasoline . patient: oh then oh bipac accom . therapist: so it ha an effect that level two . patient: yeah . therapist: so you thinking it almost like the number of transaction ha to be more than one . i mean it ha to be two or zero . patient: yeah i guess so . yeah . no . or vitamin or number of transaction ? yeah . because see if i get gas then i have the gas in my car . that the thing . therapist: that one transaction and one thing and one thing okay . and then . okay so that one product right ? and you need another product . right ? so you really ca feel your car without going inside the station . store . patient: no therapist: so it doe matter that there more than one gallon going in is because it the same product . patient: exactly . yes . therapist: so i could see now this this would be more of a daily thing . you said right . yeah . because at first i wa thinking daily . that a lot of individual shopping trip but it applies to all transaction . patient: exactly . yeah . i did really realize that that way . but it doe . yeah . yeah . therapist: so this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you . patient: yes it is . it doe . pr i get you know like build up in me and i feel it . therapist: so let talk about that . and help me to understand this better . so let say that you went to a convenience store and just had one thing in mind what might be a potential item that you would gum ? gum right ? so you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum . that all you really want . that why you stopped at the store . patient: right therapist: so you go in you have any thought ? now we talked in the past about automatic thought these thought just kind of come in right . so are there any thought in there happening when you walking into the store ? patient: yeah i start . i start with what do i need ? why am i here ? you know i need a pack of gum . and then it instant anxiety that what else am i gon na get ? what else can i get to make it the two ? therapist: all right . so the thought is what else can i get ? yeah like this one the past will be two ha to be two . it ha to be two . that not that yeah . so that also possible more demanding . yeah . so it ha to be . patient: yeah . so i guess the first thought is what else ? what else do i have to get ? yeah . and then so jump right therapist: to the anxiety . so is the anxiety patient: it start going down . okay therapist: so it really gradually patient: yes but it is really it is really yes . once it completely gone . when i done that therapist: alright so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty . when you do know the second yeah patient: absolutely . all right . therapist: okay . so if you could relieve that anxiety that would be one of your goal . patient: that would be fantastic . fantastic . therapist: all right . so let think about this way . do you ? do you know the reason that you do this ? you have any guess ? patient: i would guess that . i mean we talked about you my dad had some bad experience i had i sound awful . yeah they they were difficult . so i wonder if that not somehow linked to this behavior somehow . being impossibly therapist: alright . so you been through some really tough time to put it mildly . and what you afraid of if you only buy the one item ? is something safety related happening ? patient: yes . yes . like the car accident or the yes . safety . definitely my personal safety or my family safety . therapist: and i guess security like the patient: security yeah . and yeah security . therapist: so safety and security . they at risk for you . patient: yes . therapist: when you do follow this role the rule and i will yeah . so if we think about it in term of the cognitive model we talked about the core belief and the intermediate belief which are the attitude and assumption expectation so the core belief here the only thought when it might be patient: well now that you said that or you know pointed out those safety security issue i did really realize that but it is . maybe that just that i not okay i not therapist: i not okay . i not safe . i am vulnerable patient: vulnerable . yeah i vulnerable . am i an exposed ? exposed to danger to ? therapist: sure at risk ? yeah . patient: that my rule . therapist: and then when a situation present itself which would be an impending transaction . that the situation we talked about how the situation blend together . with that in this case rule that intermediate . so when they come together what that automatic thought ? patient: when the situation and therapist: trend potential transaction approaching you and you handed me a belief i need to buy everything patient: in tear . what else am i getting in ? therapist: and then what the behavior ? that is a product of that automatic thought of i do you buy the second item ? yeah . and the feeling is the feeling of fall . patient: that follows that purchase of therapist: well the follows on mac thought oh anxiety anxiety and then what the feeling that follows the purchase ? yeah . relief relief . alright . so can you see how the mechanism what happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive load patient: there much it did sit very well . therapist: alright . so let talk about the rule of the rule of two . now we we we talked before we talking about cognitive therapy about useful and le than useful thought right ? functional and le functional or dysfunctional . thought . do you think that sitting here now not so much necessarily in the store ? i know that probably a different thought process . but talking with me now do you see a causal connection between purchasing two item and a safety or security breach ? patient: yeah . i mean there no i recognize you recognize your work and stuff that it not . it doe make sense . it not a useful a useful thought maybe therapist: it not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: so you recognize that you appreciate that . there is not a link between elio purchasing here . and in either direction though right meaning so you realize that that if you buy to this doe necessarily keep you safe either . so you ca introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe you ca introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior . patient: that very true . yeah . therapist: doe that make sense ? patient: yeah it doe . it really doe . i ca it doe make what you saying make sense . but it doe make sense to introduce safety or either side of the point . therapist: so do over or rest are not influenced by your behavior . patient: yeah . therapist: but that not what your mind is telling you . that not what your thought are telling you . that logical . and you can sit here with me . and it not easy to say but you can say yeah i do see a link . patient: yeah i do see a link but i know what i feel and what i feel is that impending doom if you will . therapist: so let talk about that moment . so in this moment maybe a little anxious now but you can kind of see how right you ca protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else . by buying to or failing to buy to write in the store or wherever you make the transaction different story . so you have let let go a different direction . i talked about how you walk into a store and you think well i get those the phone right ? and you end up getting something else . yes the anxiety then kind of go away . and we come up the next time that happens . but it a way it gone for that moment . so i want you to kind of stay with me a i go through another scenario . and you maybe have figured out what i going to do here but patient: i need it in your scenario . okay . therapist: so maybe gm is the ideal example but you see my right yeah . see you go into the now you go to the store you realize you only have enough resource to make the one transaction and you really want it so zero is not . so now walk me through the thought and the feeling patient: what i would normally do or what i therapist: would think would happen patient: i would panic . i mean not panic like break down or something but i mean it would be very very stressful if i absolutely had to get that item . um i would probably try to scrape change out of my car but i know we not going there now . yeah no stay there . but um i would be very very difficult . therapist: could you do it ? patient: i physically capable of doing it . okay . therapist: and that is one level of being able . but how about in term of your thinking ? and your feeling ? patient: i could do it i could do it . i could get through it . therapist: and what would happen ? how much anxiety with you experience and with the anxiety fade off ? patient: it will fade off ? i think . i mean it would have to i would imagine so it would fade . i think it would take a longer period of time to fade than if i had just gotten even now seeing here but even if i had just gotten another item okay the world is going to be safe for another five minute . we good . how much you feeling right now ? very anxious right ? yeah . therapist: are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you worried that something catastrophic is gon na happen ? okay so even talking about a transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety and security . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: so you can you can trigger that without a transaction even pending . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: really scared sitting here . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: is unbearable the anxiety of men embarrassment ? patient: yes it bearable it bearable therapist: but doe it hurt stuff ? patient: yeah it hurt me feel bad . therapist: what do you feel is gon na happen with seeing xiety about patient: your scenario of having to having to get only one item or having only having the resource for one item and therapist: okay so it not a safety and security . it a it a concern about going through and buying one item on the rule . those two yeah yeah . and i talking about breaking the rule . patient: i know it terrifying . this this this skin for you . therapist: because so you anxious about that . and you also anxious about the consequence of that . patient: yeah . therapist: so the anxiety you experiencing right now in this moment with me i want you to be mindful that guy keep that in your awareness and let me know if that change . just interrupt me if you need to . it not . patient: okay . therapist: so it might get worse . it might get better . so is there something on your mind that you need to buy within the next couple of day ? patient: yes . coffee coffee . therapist: that a transaction of one . patient: yes so i get something . therapist: okay right . yeah . understandable but what if what if i challenged you to behavioral experiment . okay can you guess what that might be ? patient: to buy one coffee ? in scenario two therapist: to buy one to buy one cup of coffee ? and then i do know where to buy the coffee but leave ? yeah wherever it is leave . so what are the possible thing that could happen ? knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing and you might be anxious about that . and that real that anxiety is real . but knowing that the event is prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior . let go through what happens . so you buy the coffee . you really anxious . right ? up to it you anxious to go into driving there either . patient: i would have a lot more anxiety . but i would really have to talk myself through that . therapist: would it go away ? patient: i believe it wa the anxiety i believe . therapist: so it be more painful experience to buy the one . patient: yes yeah . therapist: but it would actually harm you . patient: oh yeah . no not at all . therapist: but it would cause you more internal anxiety . patient: exactly . therapist: so what would happen if you did again patient: i would hope that it would be le anxiety . could be could be therapist: repeated time . patient: it could be i would get old . i think the anxiety would get exhausted . therapist: so really what you doing is you conditioning you be conditioning yourself right to to to surviving just buying the one item . i have a lot more money financial advantage to it certainly . and there be a you know what i hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miner the next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example i mean i asked one thing you going to buy the coffee but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this ? i do know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe i guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example the gasoline because you get your car by the gasoline and you leave . yeah that would be easier for you . you will be tempted by the other i patient: would have to walk through the coal to the store right or to the the door of the therapist: wood . that be easy . it be you know might be patient: that would be much easier . okay . therapist: so we will we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptom . yeah that would be wonderful . and maybe another step in the future if we get there . so it go with u but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let not let not do that . okay . let stick with the gasoline . patient: okay . i feel more confident about that . therapist: you feel like you could succeed with that . yeah experiment . patient: we see when we actually get there but yes i would like to . i feel like i could actually try that . more so than the coffee . so therapist: are you afraid with the coffee that you might just end up buying too ? okay . patient: yes . therapist: so how your anxiety now ? patient: i feel better than i do have to just buy one cup of coffee . therapist: okay so that wa a stressor . patient: but i feel it it mile . but but okay . but it wa . therapist: but mostly because the experiment that we talking about somewhat easier patient: and because i think like the insight that you gave me on i had connected the safety security i had connected all the dot . so that wa very helpful . therapist: so one of the we talked about before what do i mag thought like adaptive response right . so a you trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car you going to have those thought still come up . and the adaptive response could be something like well i like you to design it or work with me and design it . but could be something like i know this will actually have a consequence in the real world . yeah i realized this is just how responding internally doe take away the anxiety necessarily . it might but it will help you maybe get through that process . yeah . yeah . doe that make sense ? yeah absolutely . there a few thing i asking you to do . right . one is to just buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline . and at the same time when those thought come up to respond to them with the adaptive response to compare the two . patient: yeah gotcha . therapist: apparently got it . right . so i know this wo have real consequence . in reality that could be one . and if you have any others you know you can apply to a well a apply them . i know that i can tolerate the anxiety . yeah seems like you tolerated for a long time . it not pleasant . it not what you want . but you can tolerate . patient: yeah . therapist: and maybe another adapter response would be this is painful for me . but if i can be successful here if i can get rid of thing patient: yeah . the longer term picture yeah . therapist: and keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goal . like that . yeah that make sense . patient: i like that a lot . therapist: so we kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angle here . okay ? patient: yeah . therapist: so do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea ? patient: yeah i do . it been a long time . but i that i mean the behavior and the thought process have been in place for a long time . so i think it be a challenge but i think you know it time therapist: yeah . so well that can be very positive so that you know what i detected there wa you ready to challenge the six idea . right ? like i would like to take the devil courage . yeah yeah . so you ready to say i had enough . and you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you ready to take the anxiety on . that can be a positive adaptive response right ? like being assertive and saying almost like you talking to the anxiety in a way okay right but i not gon na let you beat me this time . that what you be saying to the anxiety . patient: i like that one . yeah . therapist: so make a note of all these right ? and you can use the same one more than once . you can mix them up whatever work for you . okay but keep applying them a needed through the whole process into your home your is your no more risk to go by . it great . yeah . cuz it because i think once you get home really that that the completion of only participating that one transaction right you left and go back to restarting the cycle . so right . you you permanently recorded just buying the one thing . yeah so that a victory . yeah . that be a huge victory . so i do know if you know the status of your gas tank right now . do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week ? patient: oh yeah you do ? need to do that . yeah . therapist: so if you could try that out . and if you could record kind of in the moment like after it over the experience in term of your feeling different stage that would be helpful . patient: okay patient: okay . all right . thanks .",
            "the patient is anxious about the shopping habit that they have . the patient feel to buy everything in pair of two . the patient ha the urge to look for another thing around the store if they have only one thing to buy . they are okay to not buy anything at all too . the patient clarifies it applies to any money transaction which ha to be two or zero . the patient experience worse anxiety when they enter a shop without knowing the second item . the patient belief that this behavior is linked to their personal and family safety . they feel vulnerable . the patient feel relieved when they buy two item . the patient can have bearable anxiety triggered just be talking about one transaction . the therapist suggests to buy one coffee and once it is done a time the patient anxiety would get exhausted . the patient agrees to try and affirms they did feel to link this to safety and security . this can reduce their symptom . the therapist give another suggestion to buy gasoline alone and get back home . if they successfully get back home that a mark of completion and victory to the patient . the therapist asks to respond them with adaptive response for the two and make note of their experience ."

patient: i do know i guess . i guess i see that you saying that like i really need to go to the hospital . i guess i wa hoping a little bit that you would be happy for me that i wa feeling better . but i think that you want me to go to the hospital . so i do know . it make me think about whether it the right decision . you know therapist: mean a suicide ? patient: yeah . therapist: sometimes and you know you been with me like i said about almost a year now and you been depressed much that time . and it not unusual . when somebody think they found a solution to depression even if that solution something that i am against like suicide that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain . there other thing we can do and have done the past try to get you out of pain . patient: but we have done them in the past and i did feel better and now i am feeling better . so you know i i just want you to accept that . therapist: but i not going to it my obligation with it i happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive . i seen you this way before and i know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from a suicidal thought and feeling you did well for week sometimes month at a time . you seeing really just the darkest when you in the patient: yeah but i feeling better now . therapist: temporarily because you feel you found the end to the pain which i understand . i mean understand you feeling better but you feeling better because you plan on killing yourself . and we talked about how devastating that would be to your family right ? your friend . patient: i am torturing them with my sadness i just making their life miserable . i do understand how it gon na help them for me to stay alive . you know i worth more they can have my life insurance . and you know i wo make them suffer anymore . therapist: so your logic is that if you end your life you freed them from having to deal with patient: yeah . and feel like the right thing to do therapist: and a you know i mean you signed release i talked to your husband your parent they repeatedly said that despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression they would much rather have you alive why would they say that ? patient: i think that they scared of the pain of losing me but i know that they feel better eventually . therapist: so they feel good over the grief ? patient: yeah therapist: i understand . patient: and i think that they understand that i needed this . therapist: you know i been doing this for a while . right . i think we come to have a good relationship . patient: yeah . therapist: and i would hope that i earned your trust and you value my opinion . we do something that i know about suicide . you open to hearing it ? patient: yeah therapist: there a lot of way that people die . right . and it it really what eventually will happen to u all . it hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide . meaning when somebody dy of an illness or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident people grieve right ? but there usually not a blame assigned to that mean they do feel guilty . doe that make sense ? patient: yeah therapist: they feel sad because they lost the person but they do feel responsible for that person death . suicide is different when somebody commits suicide their family and friend feel responsible . they have no answer to all the question that they have . they could never get an answer . patient: i gon na write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it not their fault because it not their fault and i just want them to be happy without me . therapist: so you believe the note will take away all that pain ? patient: no but i think that it will help them realize that they should feel guilty like you saying therapist: it mitigate that pain ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . i can tell you from experience that note note do really help . if anything it another artifact that they can agonize over . i know it hard to see from your perspective because you kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their life because they lost you . and it a it a special horrible type of agony that come with feeling responsible for causing someone death . i know you do want that . patient: i just do know why you ca let me feel better . therapist: i know it frustrating . i know it hard to understand . the time when you gone to the hospital before you have felt better . your outlook wa completely different not . but it wa completely different when you came out . i mean you still a little down but nowhere near the depression we want to hurt yourself . is it possible if you go to the hospital this time you could come out feeling better again ? patient: yeah it possible . therapist: i gon na make arrangement to get you out of the hospital . i know . i know you do . and we had this conversation before . right ? i realized that you know you not happy with some of the condition there . but you usually talk finally about the group . right ? you usually do well in the group . and typically well every time right every time you been in the hospital you come out feeling better . i know it not what you want to hear . i know you want me to be happy that you gon na enjoy life but that would make me happy . that would make anybody happy . i know you think it would make you happy . but i can tell you it not the answer . i like you to go voluntarily through this process . will you do that ? patient: ok let go therapist: all right . i go make those arrangement and we can show you . okay ? patient: okay .",
            "this is a classic love story between a woman and a man . it is more about the passage of time . patient feel the same old thing that i wa worried about before you know the depression and and you know my relational issue my job . therapist know patient signed release therapist talked to husband parent of patient they repeatedly said that despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression they would much rather have you alive"

            "therapist: so i understand that you come in because you having a little difficulty in your relationship about that . patient: so basically it been getting a little bit worse since we got married . we got married about a year and a half ago . and you know the the woman that i married i thought we were both kind of independent people . and i thought that we would kind of go our separate way or thing like we used to college but it kind of gotten to the point now where it like i just want my own personal space and i i do want to be left alone sometimes . therapist: alright so you looking for independence in your relationship . now how long have you been together ? about a year ? patient: total four or five year married for a year and a half . therapist: and when franklin did you notice that ? what you kind of think it wa the problem like the independence lack of independence ? patient: i guess kind of once we got married after that it seemed like you know we were spending all of our time together which you know at first wa great because we newlywed you know we love spending time together and everything but i guess probably about you know six month to a year after we first got married it kind of you know progressed to the point where you know now it just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever i do she always there with me . we always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it just nice to have my own personal space is freedom you know . therapist: so you looking for that freedom . sarah this kind of resonate with you ? therapist: can you can you tell him that ? therapist: so frank what it like to hear that ? patient: it kind of reminds me of how it used to be you know like she said we been dating for four or five year and you know back then it it wa a problem you know she could go out and do her own thing i could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we spending every moment together you know it just i always worried about her she always worried about me and you know when when i do get the chance to go you know hang out with some friend or something like that . it always feel like you know i pressure on me because i should be with her . she should be there with me you know and i feel like i doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do thing by myself . i feel guilty . i do . therapist: so sarah do you sense that and frankly feel guilty about that ? therapist: you feel rejected . patient: this a little bit after . so like i said probably the first six month to a year it wa it wa really good . but then you know reselling is kind of a burden . you know just always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fight because we always spending so much time together . therapist: so you mentioned that the six month to a year ha been the same for you like wa the beginning of the marriage something different to what you have that therapist: so for you a couple month after that initial phase . so around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage therapist: okay are you okay with some space ? patient: you do seem real certain . therapist: so maybe this this idea of space is really something you feel will work for you . therapist: do want to try to address frank concern about the space ? therapist: you seem apprehensive about it . therapist: so maybe just experiment with it try it for one night and see what happens . so in the year and a half you been married is there ever been a night when you gone out by yourself ? patient: yeah it been a couple especially earlier on which is nice you know just you know getting to see old friend and you know our old college friend like of course we attended you know event together and like seeing old friend and everything like that but there been there been a few time you know not not more than i can count on both my hand but there been a few time where i you know gone out and just had like you know a guy night or something . therapist: okay and what would happened like in term of like between you so patient: just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part . you know just finding a way to ensure that you know it be okay . i going to be back home later on in the night that she doe need to worry about me you know if i have any trouble or anything pop up that i need her help i let her know . and you know just knowing that i love her and telling her that i love her and making sure that she know that i be back . but you know sometimes it hard because she just get upset when i tell her that i leaving and she doe want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me . and you know i do want to be the only guy that show up with my wife . you know everybody else left their wife at home also . so i do want to be the odd man out therapist: all right so this is really an experiment that already been tried . patient: tried twice . yeah therapist: yeah . just just a few time . is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week it be different ? patient: that not good . therapist: do you do think so . patient: well yeah . mean we been doing it you know the past couple month but it seems like every time we do is you know the same result it her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it gon na be okay and you know that we so married we still in love you know everything like that but you know it just i really want my space and it seems like sometimes i just ca get out of her crib . therapist: sir what do you think about that ? therapist: all right . so in term of the going out although going out with your friend would have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week . patient: yeah absolutely . you know a lot of my friend normally go out during the week because you know they have their family and everything to take care of on the weekend . so yeah i could definitely go out tonight during the week . therapist: okay so you could agree . the both of you could agree to that a kind of term of this behavioral experiment or weekend you spend those weekend together . patient: i think we could try that . therapist: because that wa a concern you specifically brought up . how about sarah how about the time during the week ? how do you feel about those ? therapist: you feel like you respond better to that ? would that be a better experience ? therapist: something that you think that you could try next week . therapist: so let talk about when because you gone out before and you said it wa just getting out . getting out the house that wa the the real challenge right ? so walk me through . this really go through both of you . what we through what happens when you when you getting ready to leave when you planning to head out ? patient: so you know usually i go get dressed i let her know where i going you know give her my cell phone number you know somebody else phone number in case my phone is off . just basically tell her what we going to do you know whether we going out to to a pole or you know going to watch some sporting event or something like that . no i would tell her what we doing you know just so she know and know where she can find me . but then after that it seems like a soon a i assure her of what we doing and when it happening when i be home everything like that it just seems like all the progress i made towards the front door kind of get pulled back a little bit because like she doe want me to leave you know i can see in her eye that she not very happy about me leaving her . and that kind of make me feel guilty you know because i do want to leave her alone . i want her to be more independent . i kind of want her to you know if i going out i would like her to go out a well . you know she say ton of friend . you know we both have friend . we both have our social circle . and she kind of it frustrating when i ca go do my thing because she always got to be with me . therapist: so ultimately after all that you you do go but you feel feel guilty . and do you have a good time ? patient: most of the time right ? do you know sometimes i just ca get over the fact that you know my wife at home who upset at me and that make me upset . you know it just a matter of finding the balance between you know my independence and her you know doing her own thing because i would like her to do that a well . therapist: so sometimes you have a good time sometimes you do . you worried about sarah being home . how about when you come home ? patient: when i come home usually thing go back to normal . i mean we definitely had our exchange of word after a few time me coming back . but most of the time it go back to normal which you know it fine . we very loving affectionate couple . so that awesome . but you know most the time it just overbearing . therapist: is that how you see it sarah the way frank described it ? therapist: so how about one is out ? like so after after he left ? what do you what are you thinking that ? like ? therapist: you anxious something bad gon na happen . therapist: do you think that there been any reason for that thinking like do you think there any basis for thinking something bad gon na happen ? patient: absolutely not . no no i love sarah you know the five year that we worked together been great you know it it just where we are now a opposed to where we first were and when we first got married it it changed and you know i would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes . and i guess i do always relay that well to her and she doe understand why i want my space . i want to go hang out with my friend but i been trying to explain to her that you know it it a two way street . it not just all one way and so we have to work on these issue . and you know that why we came to you . therapist: alright so you really frustrated by not being able to go out go out . but you anxious about when he go out . so we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sound like we might run to the same difficulty you experienced before . what can we change to increase the chance of that experiment working ? therapist: so so if you called when he wa at piedmont the answer is that something that normally possible . patient: yeah . yeah . most of the time i very good at responding to you know making sure that she know i okay . making sure that she okay . therapist: so that a compromise you be willing to make . absolutely something like that . patient: yeah . therapist: you need any other reassurance from frank sarah ? therapist: do you have a plan to call frank ? like when he out ? or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to or therapist: were you calling for some specific reason ? therapist: why do you start reinsurance ? everything going right . okay so that seems reasonable to you . right ? i mean i i guess patient: but at the same time like when i out doing my own thing you know i kind of want that privacy in that you know just being in the moment you know because i know when i get back home from back with you and i nothing changed because i always been with you like we still married . but when i out with my friend and you know i getting a couple phone call during you know the night over the course of the night and it having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she know i okay and everything like that it it get a little frustrating . it a little i mean frustrating therapist: would that be a good compromise ? it wa a text or two . i guess . that better than a phone call right ? yeah . so not ideal but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit . right ? and maybe work toward a little bit more freedom . so that how i can experiment you both combined to try . patient: okay so we could try and try it out . therapist: alright . so it not a perfect plan . but it one that you know i would hope that we could be successful with if you could though you going through it maybe track what happens right from your own perspective like what you were thinking the fact left what you were thinking when you left how it went how that separation kind of wa conducted . and what happened . same thing when while you out how many time you texted her if you called and then what happened when he got back ? right ? that just kind of and you can you can keep a record of those thing just independently . you know you write it down come your experience and you write down your experience . and we come back next time . no matter what happens with it we compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustment to to make it work even better .",
            "the patient got a married one and a half year ago . they have been having trouble with their personal space being independent and the lack of it both . frank ha issue to do thing independently a he feel pressure to be with her . it make him feel guilty . sarah feel rejected . the patient have experimenting hanging out separately twice and it ha worked out well . frank express that he feel the need to assure sarah when he is out and sarah feel anxious for the time when frank is out . sarah agrees a couple text and a phone call when frank is out will help . the therapist asks to note down these experience before the next meeting of how they both feel and it can be discussed in the next session ."

            "therapist: yes you really get where they coming from you really understand the suffering bowl . patient: yeah i guess maybe that part of where it so hard for me is like i know that i causing a lot of suffering for people . therapist: well let let talk about that . so you in you in a position where you have to make some decision about people life . and sometimes those decision result in people being separated from the family . sometimes they do . are you really the cause ? in the larger picture ? are you really the cause of these family being broken up ? patient: i guess not like it their action if they were doing the right thing even if i did come in their kid would be removed . but it is still hard to be the one that pull that trigger you know . therapist: well you the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process but the true cause happened year or month before you got there a people made decision that maybe were the best for their child for themselves . so you really coming in to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choice patient: yeah . that true . therapist: ultimately for this family that causing you the cycle that you worried about . in kind of the looking at the long term length do you think the child are better off ? because they not with a family right now ? patient: i mean if they get with a good family which you know usually they do . it it good for them you know maybe it could be a wake up call for the parent or if not at least the kid are getting their need met and stuff like that . it probably really hard for the kid and they probably want to go back to their parent . but i think overall we would be doing this if we did think that it would be best for the kid to go to a place where they going to be taken care of . therapist: so immediately there some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run . maybe there a better result . even with that though let talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision . so this based on what you describing do you believe this wa actually a poor decision ? patient: i guess not . it just feel like it is . therapist: yeah it feel like it is . and it wa a tough decision . but looking at it in the weight of the evidence . maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time . patient: yeah . yeah i think so . and i not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either . therapist: so you really did what you had to do . because there still a pain component there for them . you feeling torn . and you do want to go through this again ? patient: no i mean not this feeling . but i do want to keep doing my job . therapist: but doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake that not a appealing . patient: yeah i mean i guess i always knew i could make mistake but it just feel really real now i guess that is the difference . therapist: so in this particular instance this what you saying doe seem like a mistake . let consider a situation where you did make a mistake . that would be the worst case right ? we just taking thing to the worst case scenario . okay . your fear here is that in a sense regardless of what already happened going forward you be mortified to make an error . because this pain you feeling right now . there just a variable that thrown everything into chaos for you . so looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession what the mistake you see people make from time to time and you be frightened of . patient: i guess the biggest mistake you can really make is to miss some form of abuse or something like that . therapist: and then someone hurt . okay .",

            "therapist: hi hazel how are you doing today ? patient: okay therapist: what been going on ? patient: well last time i started to tell you a little bit about one of my friend my best friend actually she had this issue . so what happened wa she went to a bathroom at our local library and she found a video camera when she wa going to the bathroom therapist: in the bathroom ? patient: yeah she actually yeah . and she turned it into the police . and i guess because like she carried it or she had found it . her hand print were on it and they were able to they were able to detect who actually did it . they were able to catch the therapist: probably did catch the person ? patient: no . so send then i been on really just high alert like i worried that that could happen to me to my kid . and i just really worried because they did catch the guy that him or someone like him could be out there . therapist: so he still out in the community right ? so how is it affecting your your daily life ? can you tell me kind of what your where you been feeling ? patient: a lot of anxiety just not knowing maybe you know what if someone were to videotape me like that i been very aware shall i say of camera . therapist: okay so anxious and aware patient: right like i know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone camera . therapist: right patient: just all the possibility that i could be recorded . i just been very aware of them which make me not want to go anywhere . so i been having arguing with my husband a lot because he want to go out to restaurant and i do want to go because there could be camera in the bathroom and how i dress also a you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because i remember hearing once about camera that people use on shoe that could be you you know use in a creepy way and so i i ca you know it now almost summertime i ca dress and skirt or be comfortable because i dressing like that . therapist: so you have covered a lot of ground there . so you have the you have the feeling of being like worried nervous whether that gon na happen to you . but you also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer . patient: right therapist: ha that helped ha ha changed in the way you dressed or changing where you go and when you go is that help reduce the anxiety ? patient: not really no i would say it really starting . that why i wanted to come in . it really starting to affect my life . therapist: you mentioned specifically your husband ha like what been going on here ? patient: he just want to go place with our kid like go out to eat and and i do really want to go anywhere that because you know camera are everywhere nowadays . therapist: they are patient: and i just kind of worried like public bathroom could they be there someone being you know sometimes baby monitor or you know have two phone and people can hack into that . laptop camera . so even in my own house i just been really nervous . so i feel like i not really getting relief from that anxiety . therapist: have you taken any precaution because of this persistent worry . patient: i mean i read therapist: i wa already mentioned like with the camera specifically . i mean patient: i um you know when i go into bathroom i i been looking for camera to make sure they were there before you know me or my child that need a bathroom . i have tried i read online you can learn how to turn off the camera on your phone and that you can close your laptop in that way the camera will face down . so and the same thing on a smart tv so it doe recognize your face . i i tried to turn thing off they do need to be on a far a people being able to access myown information therapist: and that seems reasonable . once you take reasonable precaution to try to avoid being video recorded patient: right therapist: against your will . patient: exactly . therapist: but still you have this feeling of worry anxiety and your your schedule being interfered with ? patient: right . therapist: skewed you like to cope more effectively with your feeling reduces anxiety . so when you enter into a public bathroom and we talked about automatic thought before those thought it just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feeling . that can be unpleasant patient: right . therapist: like anxiety and worry . so when you walk into a public restroom what the first thing that go through your mind ? patient: that there might be a video camera that i do see that that maybe like with my friend that wa big enough but i might not catch it in that someone going to use that in a vulgar way . therapist: okay so when you walk in you wondering if there a camera there . patient: yeah . therapist: and when that automatic thought occurs what follows that in term of a feeling or behavior ? patient: usually i try and find the camera but it usually anxiety fear . my heart rate start going up i start getting really anxious and then you know i try and either rush to use the bathroom if i really have to go or a lot of time if i do i just leave . sometimes i try and use bathroom at home so i do have to go out . therapist: so you behavior looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using a restroom . and you you feeling is that that anxiety worry there ? patient: yeah therapist: we been talking about . okay . so really if we think about we talked before about the core belief intermediate belief and wonder if the intermediate belief is it i vulnerable . or this more specifically maybe it more of a core belief . more specifically i vulnerable in this area like put this guy on the loose patient: right therapist: you know committed that crime . and then you know that combining with situation that you encounter and that where you getting those automatic thought . so that sort of make sense . patient: exactly . therapist: okay . so you remember what what in term of kind of therapy you like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk . so it that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you having an automatic thought that going to be to in this case anxiety and worry and behavior that are looking for the camera is maybe useful behavior but leaving you know that that that could certainly be on useful behavior . so in term of that self talk let let work to develop a self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial you know i wonder if there a camera in this bathroom . right ? what do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feeling you having ? patient: i could say if when i walked in the bathroom ? therapist: umm hmm patient: maybe i could say umm you know while there could be a chance that there a camera in this bathroom the chance of it happening is not very likely . and you know i gon na take step to keep myself safe so that i wo be in a vulnerable position such a looking for the camera . therapist: but it good . so you have you have a low probability of it happening and you taking useful behavior to minimize your risk even further . patient: right . therapist: right . so that a good automatic thought i think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather . why do you why do you try that one out ? right the next time . you had that on that thought ? right . try out that . you know i think that really you know that logical . i mean it it unlikely to happen . of course there a chance . right patient: right . therapist: and we we acknowledge that in the self talk there a chance that it could happen but there precaution you can take . that a low chance sometimes a well so keep that on mac thought . we review it in the end patient: okay therapist: right before you leave today we write these down . but that that one adaptive response rather that i want to write down for you . i also want to talk about like the worst case scenario because right now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it unlikely it could happen . it could happen . and i wondering how you think you would react ? if it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been you know watching you right on recording . how would react to that ? patient: i mean i think i would be really upset . i think i would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant . i mean i would think ultimately that would be okay . my friend is happened a while ago she starting to get to get over it and get back to her usual routine although she still hesitant so i think i would be okay . eventually although i be really upset that it happened . therapist: and it would make sense to feel upset . but that would be upsetting for anybody . but a you noted that would probably be relatively temporary . patient: that right . therapist: distress right ? well acute and certainly you would be happy about it . it should be happy about it . patient: right therapist: it would probably go away . i learned to adapt . how long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry ? patient: probably it happened like two month two month ? therapist: and how many day and the average week are you affected by these feeling ? patient: every day therapist: every day ? patient: yeah . therapist: so if we can compare it right we have a chance to be recorded right illegally . that a low probability event . it could happen . probably not likely . the anxiety and worry that you having . that a high probability event because you suffering from every day . patient: and that true . i never thought about it that way . therapist: so there a there a point at which maybe you reach and you say i rather take that route to take the risk i rather deal with the potential consequence of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens then be in the state of anxiety worry patient: right because right now i suffering every day . therapist: now you suffering right ? and if if you could adaptively respond effectively you you still gon na have that risk of being recorded . but you know you could survive that event if it happened late . patient: i can get it therapist: and you taking reasonable caution and you know thing we talked about . so a you think about this in a more general sense is there a adaptive response you could apply it to that to that on that thought of you know i need to be worried about this or you know whatever that thought look like sometimes the thought in image right may like an image have been recorded but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thought are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house . what adapter response ? could you apply there ? patient: maybe you know like i said i worried about all the camera maybe i could say you know i understand there some camera that you know use for good purpose security therapist: probably most are patient: right . and the chance of being recorded illegally are not likely if and i taking precaution to you know go to the right place . the good area good area . so it not likely to happen overall . and me going outside the house is worth the risk . you know the minimal risk that it would happen and if it did happen i could survive . therapist: that great . that a great adaptive yeah . and actually that kind of a few adaptive response . patient: right right . therapist: but that good . and you can you can apply them and we we kind of break them down . patient: okay . therapist: like i said before you leave today we break those down . so you can you could have written down a you go out . i think it important because the automatic thought tend to spring on u quickly . it important to rehearse these adaptive response . so we ready to go . patient: okay . therapist: right . and and kind of you know we being we preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response . and in order to be prepared you you have to know what it is . so it good to have it written down to kind of more or le commit to memory . patient: okay . therapist: doe that make sense ? patient: yeah . therapist: all right . so before we leave today i take care of that . and i want you to use a adaptive response for this week . i see you next week . and record what the outcome wa every time you able to apply the response and that includes what you felt and what you actually did . patient: okay . therapist: and of course a you mentioned any physiological reaction like your heart racing right underneath that so that really that sub behavior . but note both a physiological behavior and other behavior . patient: okay therapist: yeah . once you consciously controlling and then any feeling okay ? and we go through them . we go through each time use it one by one they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it working . okay . that the plan . patient: yeah . i think that will be helpful therapist: so we go from there . and i appreciate you coming in today . patient: thank you very much . therapist: thanks .",

            "therapist: so we here today to talk about cbt and your experience of it . how did you feel initially about the thought of going for cbt patient: my clinical psychologist ha told me that i needed to see someone . i thought i did need to see someone because there wa nothing wrong with me . i just had a heart disease . and i my heart disease had got so severe and i wa just tired and there wa no one that could make it better . by listening to me or talking to me the only thing i thought that could heal me wa heart surgery . and when he suggested that i see someone it did seem to make sense . but because i wa so depressed so far gone i my husband through my husband i thought i try and just take a chance and just listen to someone or let someone listen to me because i wa sure what it entailed . i never been to a clinical psychologist before . so to me a a clinical psychologist wa a shrink you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see a clinical psychologist and i did need to see one . but when i did mita and i realized that not being able to make up my mind by waiting for surgery for heart surgery . i putting my name down on the list . i needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done because i did want to get surgery done and she listened to me and to the way i felt and what wa making me whoa hold back on surgery and what made me feel the way i did . and funnily enough a a woman you tend to feel that you can cry on someone else shoulder . but for the first time just letting my emotion out to her . she helped me cry and by me speaking to her it helped me see myself from the inside . if that make sense . i then i began to understand why i had to get heart surgery done wa because i wa tired but i had my family and everyone that went through the road with me of suffering wa mad so i needed to get it done . and then eventually i did put my name down on the list not knowing it would be done so quick because asked wa just supposed to take me six to eight month to get heart surgery done . but when i started seeing my clinical psychology i understood it i put my name down and i got my surgery done in day time . so it sound like part of the clinical psychologist role with you is to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not . yes . but you also said that you were quite depressed at the time wa the cbt helpful for your depression a well it helped because then instead of cry and holding thing back emotionally it helped me let thing out . and by letting thing out it helped me understand what i wa feeling because most of the time we bottle thing up we never let them out or we never talk to each other or other people . so when we bottle stuff up it make it harder for u to figure out way to solve problem . sometimes it can be a little problem and we turn it into a big problem because we just do communicate with other people or talk thing over to make it easier to understand . and she helped me understand and i saw her before surgery right through my heart surgery and after heart surgery and she helped me . by then by the time i started with heart surgery i lost myself confidence . i wa so depressed i wa so withdrawn . but after i had heart surgery and i carried on seeing her she helped me gain my confidence back again . she helped me gain my trust again she helped me see that there wa something worth loving for again . and a lot of time when i think of the thing that are needed for me it brings tear to my eye and make my heart swell up because i did know another person could do that for you . by just listening to you you know like when we go to mom when you got a problem and you think no one can understand but my mom can because she know what i coming from . but it not to say that clinical psychologist are like that . but it just the way they listen to you . just having that someone that can listen to you and just be there and be still be quiet and let you express yourself . that how and help you find out what problem are that you got and help you solve those problem if they can . therapist: wa there anything about the cbt in particular that you found wa helpful for you ? patient: dr . penny wa there with me every step of the way . with all the problem that i had she helped me show me that there an easier way to solve everything and not make a big problem out of everything . there always someone every step of the way that stayed to help if you need a helping hand . and that how i in by the time i finished therapy with her i found out that clinical psychologist are not just string . they are people like u and they do feel like u and it so much easier . to speak to someone when you having problem because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later . if you do have to be mentally ill you can be in a car accident any any problem in the home is something you can even have a death in the family that you can break down with . and you need somebody just to hear you how you feeling because we all assume that somebody else naturally know what i feeling or thinking . but it not that way . we all have different therapist: whether any drawback to going for cbt patient: in the beginning i did . i did have any drawback going for cbt because i wa so severely depressed i needed it . and i found that they were people all around that would help me so there wa nothing . the only thing that wa stopping me wa me . therapist: sound like it wa a good experience for u . if you go any advice that you would want to offer anyone who is thinking now about going for cbt ? patient: yes . do look at the word cbt . but look at the person behind it . because sometimes we see big word and we do understand the meaning of those word . and we assume but sometimes when we look behind the word like clinical psychologist i would have said a shrink and i would never have thought myself going to one because they deal with mental people . but it not that it you can have suffered from depression . you can suffer from any kind of illness and it so good to go to a clinical psychologist when you need them . because one sooner or later in our life we will need one and most people when you know like when you find younger people that nowadays lot of young people are going under so much stress in life . if you have got a parent or a friend and you suffering from depression those are the right people to speak to because it good to be able to have someone in your life that you can talk to . because i know there no one in my family that i can talk to . i always think my husband would never understand me . my kid would never understand me . when i go to the doctor he never ha that enough time for me . but with a clinical psychologist they make that time for you . and they listen to you you got you got that time with them to express yourself and you still got follow ups they can check on you and make sure everything right . if you not everything not alright . they can always check and find way and mean to help you . get you in touch with other people that can help you or get in touch with other people that are in the same . having the suffering from the same condition a you and you can swap idea with each other to find and live a happier life .",
            "the patient share their experience with cbt . the patient wa suffering from a heart disease and believed getting a heart surgery wa the only way to heal themselves . the patient wa feeling depressed . the patient visited a clinical psychologist and felt better also by letting emotion out to the psychologist which wa bottled up all the while . after surgery too the psychologist helped the patient to regain confidence back . the patient wa assisted by dr . penny helping them to find easier way to solve thing . the patient did not find their family member nor their doctor empathizing with them . on the other hand clinical psychologist help u express and have follow up session . the patient say they also help to get in touch with the right people who had same suffering a you and can swap idea to find and live happier life ."

therapist: this seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much . patient: boy seriously he not gon na find anybody that love him . a much a i do . trust me on that is not going to happen . therapist: so what i getting here right now is that if you do want to quit yeah yeah . and it just partly because this alcohol is divided into the argument with henry and his positive ssl relationship . yeah . i know we spoke about earlier and i know you do really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it ? like what your one shed some light on that patient: it a place where alcoholic go to discus their problem and like i said i not an alcoholic . therapist: well you a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking story and everyone just kind of help each other through this journey of being sober together . okay ? i know you do want to join a at this point in time time but hypothetically speaking generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road . patient: if this is what i have to do to get my guy back and i do it . therapist: okay well on a scale of one to being like for sure . and one being not really sure about it at all . what would you say where you are on the scale with god any ? patient: you put it that way ? everything i told you i would say six therapist: six . yeah . patient: well it all about it all about henry at the end of the day it it matter to me if i want to keep this engagement and i will do anything for that man . so of course this is what i have to do in this . this is him . let him tell you his relationship with me . and i with him is so much more important to me than drunken night at a bar . therapist: i love you man . like i said . patient: i tell him that . therapist: yeah . so right now we sitting at a six or what need to happen . maybe we can jump that money or nine patient: um you know like flexible hour maybe that is even an option . um also maybe there maybe there a place nearby somewhere like nearby my house i be great . so i have to use gas because it expensive already to go to work and it far anyway . and i like i guess i guess it ha to do with attitude a well . i do want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way i look in my drinking habit and all that so i guess i just looking for a good vibe you know i do want to be judged or labeled . therapist: now all of these are like very understandable . i mean it just of course you want some in a meeting to be close to u . you do have to commute so far . and yeah we all have very busy schedule . now the fit is very busy schedule . it definitely make sense . and of course the environment i mean if you not happy they just a human a learning environment . if you not comfortable there then it very hard for you to you know to be in that environment . yeah . blotchy today i wa wondering if it okay with you i can give you this for sure . it just for a median . you really close to your location where you live okay and my number is also on there . give me a call if you have any concern . and also i just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking . and i know it not you know easy to just notice . no it a very sensitive subject . yeah . so i want to thank you patient: . thank you for listening to me . no one ha actually sat down and talked to me about anything . i feel like you shed some light on an issue . so thank you . you very welcome really mean a lot . therapist: you very welcome . and if it okay with you perhaps we can schedule another follow up meeting . i say about two week or so . patient: yeah that sound fine . yeah that okay . two week work . two week . yeah .",

            "therapist: hello peggy how you doing today ? patient: i okay therapist: you okay . glad to hear that . yesterday when you here at the agency you took a few different test . remember that ? patient: i did . therapist: one of the test you took is called the scl the symptom checklist . do you remember taking that test ? patient: i think so . therapist: it item . and they are ranked patient: asked me like true and false question ? therapist: not true and false are number that you solve . patient: oh okay . i do remember that . okay . therapist: so i have the result from that test . i want to review some of those finding with you . patient: okay . all right . sure . therapist: so this particular instrument ha a number of what we refer to a sub scale . so these are area that are measured by the instrument right ? for example depression or anxiety . so i going to review a few of these sub scale one where you scored a little higher than we might expect . and just review those with you and see . see what you thinking we can talk about . patient: okay are you recording this ? therapist: no patient: are very worried about that ? therapist: is it what make you think i recording ? patient: because that happens to me a lot . therapist: it happens to you a lot that you get recorded . patient: i think so . yeah . yeah . therapist: remember the last time it happened ? patient: you probably yesterday therapist: and you think you were recorded while you taking this ? patient: probably . yeah . therapist: that sound worrisome . that that a feeling you get a lot that you being recorded . patient: i worry about it a lot . therapist: you worry about it a lot . patient: but you know it happening . that why i worry about it . therapist: you certain that happening ? patient: yeah . therapist: where you not being recorded now . i know . it probably feel like you are but you not . okay . patient: okay . but i appreciate you bringing up that concern with me . i think so in school therapist: in school right ? i that would make sense . so say for instance you had a percentile rank of right percentile that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than of people that took that test . okay so that make sense . so if you took a test on math or english and you would say percentile you be higher than three quarter of people took the test . okay understand ? doe that make sense ? i think so . okay . if you want me to come back to that later just let me know a i go through if it doe make sense okay . so area here on on the scl result or you were a bit higher than we would normally see . a one is the phobic anxiety scale . on that one you were about percentile . so your score wa a high or higher . than of people who take it patient: to more than half the people in the population therapist: more than half the number and half the people in the same situation a you in outpatient mental health treatment . patient: so i have more phobic anxiety than most people . therapist: it doe seem that way . yeah . so this construct would measure thing like being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowd . doe that connect with you ? is that seem like a fear that you have ? patient: yeah . okay . therapist: tell me about that . patient: i do like being on public transportation . hmm . and crowd make me nervous . if i ever have to public speak i feel like i just going to pas out . therapist: so it doe appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptom . so that that score today that percentile . that kind of make sense . patient: i kind of get that therapist: i want to move on to the next one which is paranoia . on this one you were at the . percentile . so quite a bit higher . patient: is that why you were recording me ? therapist: but this this wa recorded nothing wa recorded here . understand that a worry that you have . patient: are you going to share those result with anybody ? therapist: in your particular case the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for patient: but if the government asks you you have to give them those result . therapist: there no reason right now i did that there are certain limit to confidentiality . but in your situation here at this clinic there no reason i would share this information with the government or or anybody else other than people indicated . so the rest of the people here to treat you . and if you wanted to release the result to somebody you could sign a release i would let them have the result . patient: well i worried that i know people are recording me . and i think that that result show that i know that happening . and now you want to make it look like that mean i have a problem . when i just reporting what i know is true . therapist: well i assume you worried that patient: no i think that i know these thing are happening . but this test say that i wrong to think that it make me paranoid . therapist: oh i understand . okay . so these thing are really happening . yeah . right . but the test is arranged so that it making it look paranoid when you not exactly patient: exactly . okay . therapist: so that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale . okay . is that ? is that what you thinking ? patient: i do . yeah . therapist: and i wanted you to know that . i appreciate you telling me that . do you think it possible that it working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is actually there ? patient: no i do think so . therapist: you do think so . okay . patient: i understand that . i higher than most people . therapist: you believe their situation is different than yours . okay i understand . so the last area the last subscale i want to discus this one global scale on discus . glass subscale is one that referred to a psychoticism . and there you are at the percentile . and that when maybe you can hear thing other people hear or see thing that people do see or have belief or thinking that are far outside the norm and ca be supported by evidence . they feel like that happening to you . patient: are you going to put me away ? therapist: there there nothing here that would indicate that i gon na put you away or center anywhere . yeah i just really this the purpose of this is just to discus the result to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you . like so we gon na provide treatment to impart based on these result . patient: sometimes i hear thing other people do hear . therapist: okay so this is a this is a score that make make sense to retake the test might be right . patient: maybe that true . maybe that true . okay but i am being recorded therapist: but you believe you being recorded you starting to that . patient: close to normal . therapist: well a little bit higher than we want to see . patient: me i do like to go out much . therapist: so at the paranoid if that if that scale wa accurate in your estimation your global severity might be lower i think yeah . closer to the percentile i think . so even if you were closer to the percentile you can to understand how we concerned that your symptom are somewhat severe and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that . sure . is that okay ? patient: it is . okay . therapist: so i will meet with the counselor that will be treating you here and i going to go over these score now explain to her what you explained to me . okay in term of why you think you might have received the score . okay i go over that with her . and of course you could discus it with her too and she have the result of this test in your chart . patient: okay . okay . she not going to record our session . therapist: she she not going to be recording . okay . patient: it doe . therapist: okay . i appreciate you allow me to go over this set of result with you . and i going to show you assigned to that counselor and we move forward with treatment . patient: okay . thank thanks peggy .",
            "the therapist is reviewing the finding of scl test where the sub scale are little higher than expected . the patient is worried if the session is recorded and is assured by the therapist that it is not . the therapist highlight the patient scored percentile on phobic anxiety symptom . the patient agrees they do like public transportation crowd make them nervous and they ca speak publicly . next the therapist say the patient ha scored percentile on paranoia . the patient argues that they know they are being recorded which is a fact and stating that make the test to be true about paranoia about them which is not exactly . the patient still agrees they can be higher than most people for paranoia but not that high . the patient asks if these result be shared with the government for which the therapist clarifies it will only be shared with the treatment team . the last thing therapist highlight from the test is psychoticism in whcih they scored percentile . the patient agrees that they do hear thing that other do . the patient continues to express discomfort that they are being recorded . the therapist assured to setup the patient with a counselor and share the result with them ."

patient: um honestly i getting by . i mean i think you know darrell and i got divorced last year . he somewhere out in bc god only know where . therapist: so is he seeing sam at all or ? patient: i think they skype maybe once every couple month but he really not been in contact . and he not been sending the money that he promised he would . so we not thrilled with him right now . therapist: so ha that meant that finance have been tight or ? patient: yeah i mean i wa kind of counting on the child support to come in . you know thing are tight with three people household and then for almost since long darren been gone . my mother ha also moved in with me . she you know a you get older she starting to get a little bit more dementia . some people just stick their parent in a home but i wa the good daughter and i decided to take her into mind . therapist: so lot of change lot of thing going on . yeah . and how do you feel like you managing with all that ? patient: i mean some day are obviously better or worse than others it been a lot of change like you said i mean i not getting enough sleep i thing are tight financially . therapist: emotionally how have you been doing them and managing thing are patient: you know sometimes very stressful like if my mother ha an episode or when i get called from school but like i do think i really like depressed or anything it just it kind of day to day thing . therapist: so there are ever any time that you not managing well like you not good at able to get out of bed or do the thing that you need to do in a day . patient: there a couple morning that i sleep in but it really like i still kind of get by i get everything done i need to like i know it kind of a tough time right now but i do feel like it gon na be hopeless forever . hopefully . therapist: so some struggle but yeah okay . do you ever cope with using drug or alcohol ? patient: no i mean my mother used to drink but i tried to be really aware of not using that a a crutch . therapist: so then no drinking at all at home ? patient: no drinking and i definitely do want drug in the house for the kid . so none of either . therapist: what about making sure that sam and your little one have what they need in term of winter coat or food or or those sort of thing ? patient: i i doing the best i can you know like we have gotten a chance to get winter coat shopping yet . his from last year still kind of it it not great but it solution for now . therapist: so he wearing his coat from last year . yeah . do you have a sense about is that hard because of finance are there other reason patient: mostly finance but i mean kind of time too like to get everybody out the door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping . it a big ordeal . right ? i mean i know . we did pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either . it would be easier to add a few extra dollar in a few extra hour . therapist: right . so sam not always having the thing that he need right now then . patient: i guess not exactly . no . therapist: yeah . and what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge ? are you able to put food on the course patient: i mean we have the bulk food were membership . so when we do get out i let sam pick out thing he like to make you know macaroni stuff for sandwich cereal . that way you know sometimes he make himself breakfast in the morn . before school or dinner therapist: and what kind of thing doe sam have for dinner ? patient: like i said like he do macaroni . you know sometimes it not great but i do like the fruit or you know sometimes some snack food sometimes more comprehensive meal i guess . therapist: i wa what would you say he doe ? is he cooking ? or are you cooking or both ? patient: i guess kind of a mix of both . to be honest like therapist: so with all the stress in the house ha there been any time that people have kind of gotten really upset with sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful thing to him ? patient: not really . i mean therapist: and what about how his discipline handled in your house ? ha anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt sam in any way ? patient: no never . i mean i used to give him timeouts when he wa younger but therapist: what about sexual abuse ? ha anyone touched sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way ? excuse me ? yeah that a hard question to hear for lot of people . but i asked everybody that question patient: so no no never . i i would never let that happen to my child . okay . therapist: so so he been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch . okay . so how do you think sam doing in his close family relationship do you think sam feeling loved and supported . patient: i mean i know i guess i have really been around for him a much a i like to be obviously i do the best to let them know we know how much i care for him . sometimes we have a little bit more money i can get him something nice that he want . you know i heard him kind of he kind of a thought that oh you love the baby more than you love me . but that that obviously not true . i love both my kid . therapist: so what do you think he would say if he wa here ? and i asked him if he felt loved . patient: i hope he say yes . therapist: there some doubt ? patient: i mean like i said like i therapist: you mentioned that there wa some some some difficulty with your mom . patient: well she lived with u for the past year or so . she wa diagnosed with dementia so she ha day where she remembers everything and day where she started to slip more and more . and she just she very judgmental very opinionated . she ha the way she like thing . and therapist: ha there been any time that your mom ha become physically aggressive in the home ? patient: no never . therapist: and what about her relationship with you ? how is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home ? patient: some day are definitely better than others . she like i guess you could say i kind of tried to check her behavior when she wa getting a little bit therapist: and ha it ever come to physical blow between the two of you ? patient: no no just argument here and there . therapist: and when you mean argument how intense are those argument getting ? patient: like we raise our voice i mean it i doing the best i can here therapist: is it ever it never come to physical blow ? patient: no never . i have to take some other action if that happened . therapist: and that that that intensity is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling screaming and door slamming or people throwing object ? patient: i guess you could say we gotten pretty loud . i mean she go and kind of slam thing in her room . you know i i obviously i would ever let her hurt the kid . therapist: and where are sam and the baby when these thing are happening ? patient: sam will usually go and hide in this room maybe turn this music up . you know lee sometimes napping in the crib in the playpen i guess to be totally honest i do lose my patience and scream more than i like to but therapist: so it sound like there kind of a lot of tension and and and arguing in that relationship . how often would you say that that happening that it come to that kind of arguing and yelling place ? patient: i guess like a few time a week . therapist: can one sort of last question what ha anyone in your family been in prison or in jail ? patient: no never . therapist: okay . so thank you very much for sharing all of that . i just going to recap . sound like there been a lot of stressor and lot of change over the last year . yeah . sam status moved away which is kind of created some change in finance which have led to maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you needed or that sam ha needed . you got your mom ha moved in and there some stress and tension and arguing that happening in that . and you also told me that maybe all of these stressor and stuff have contributed to sam not feeling a loved or a cared for . on the other hand it sound like you managing emotionally and that you not using any drug or alcohol . you have told me that there are no concern regarding physical emotional or sexual abuse . for sam and his life and that nobody in your family more in sam life ha gone to prison . so i think you right there is likely a connection between kind of what happening for sam in school and the difficulty that he starting to have with all of these stress and change at home . so i going to book a follow up appointment for you and sam to come in . and at that time we talk about some of the way in which i might be able to help or develop a plan together . patient: sound sound good . thank you . okay . therapist: all right . so make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in a soon a you can . okay . patient: and you said you wanted to see sam for a bit a well . therapist: yeah . you got ta see sam right now . and then when when i done just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment . okay . all right . exactly . last all right . okay . thanks .",

            "therapist: alright so let see if we could let rank those two thing . right so one is everyone judging me how i wa and the other is a poor grade . which one is larger fear for you ? patient: i would say maybe like judging . therapist: okay so the grade a concern . patient: yeah but i figured i could do better on the subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you i feel like that doe go away a quickly therapist: what would it mean ? if they they thought you were anxious during that presentation ? patient: i guess i worried that they would think i anxious because i do know what i doing or i do belong there . therapist: so if they notice your anxiety then they think you do belong in that level patient: yeah . like i do deserve to be in that program . therapist: if they do recognize those symptom they would think that do they ? patient: they might write that maybe they think that why i anxious or that why i not doing well . therapist: well how do you feel about your ability and status in the programming room ? patient: i think you know typically i one of the top student in my program and i seen two get the concept pretty well . it just when i have to demonstrate those concept or demonstrate via like a presentation or something that i worried that you know maybe i an imposter or something but so i start to question myself . but i think in general that you know i a pretty good student before this . and i doing pretty well in the program . therapist: so you a good student you recognize that you have this one area where you do feel like you do a great job . that presentation . in term of grade you really only had one bad presentation . but grade aside you anxious . and you worried your classmate are gon na pick up on them . patient: yeah exactly . therapist: okay . so if they thought you were u were imposter . so if they thought you were imposter to say that that wa something they actually believe because of what been happening . what would that mean ? what would it mean to your classmate that you were an imposter ? patient: i do know . maybe i am . maybe i do deserve to be there . therapist: you do deserve to be there . patient: like maybe i should be in this program . i think they should just drop out . therapist: so if they believe you an imposter based on these physical symptom like anxiety and mood that mean to you anyway that that mean you should be on there . patient: yeah . therapist: what it feel like to say that patient: depressing i feel like i worked really hard . you know to get through atleast halfway through my program . and it really hurt to think that that will be true . therapist: just think this whole time you really been given faking do you really belong there ? . so i like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence . so in this kind of therapy we like to look at what you know what we feeling and what we thinking and what we can see what observable around u . and you know that becomes evidence and then we analyze it evaluate it okay . you worried at some level . you worried that you do deserve to be where you are right now . yeah . that you not good enough . to be a student in this program yeah programming . what evidence support that belief that you not good enough ? patient: now that i thinking about it here i mean there not a ton to support . but in on that day i can think of all sort of you know thing to tell myself therapist: what going on that day . patient: so maybe like i not prepared or because i messing up on the presentation that i going to get a bad grade and you know if i ca speak in front of people how am i going to speak in front of kid a a teacher you know one day that it will translate to something else . i ca get past this . therapist: so even if you survived the program somehow you might be bad at your job patient: yeah therapist: any other evidence that point toward you being imposter ? patient: besides my bad grade ? not a whole lot . therapist: right . so to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of i not good enough is kind of based on your feeling of anxiety . patient: yeah . which are really intense like panic almost in the moment . therapist: yeah so in a way you believing with the anxiety will lead you to believe . patient: yeah definitely . therapist: but in the bright light of scrutiny there are a lot of fact to support the worst case which is you do deserve it . how about evidence that refutes that you not good enough ? patient: i would say that you know i wa accepted into the program . like there kind of like a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff which i passed to get interview and such to get into the program . so i did that . like i said i a pretty good student all considering you know before this kind of flick wa happening . therapist: okay so you got through a rigorous process to become a student you doing well . you mentioned before just the one bad grade right ? okay so if you have friend in this program right if one of them came to you with this this balance of you know one bad grade and some anxiety yeah versus passing you know rigorous standard and doing well otherwise what advice would you give them ? patient: i mean now that you kind of like talking about it like you know this or that sort of thing . it make sense . i would probably say that well you seem to be doing pretty well so far . you know that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you doing your performance rather than that one grade therapist: would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself ? patient: i think i tried to sometimes but my anxiety symptom kind of like really like you were saying your anxiety tell you sort of i think i can think that but i think my anxiety symptom are such in the moment that it really hard . you know and i replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again . therapist: so so let look at the the thought and the feeling . if you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program like right now right now yeah but here with me . how much of your mind belief that that true ? patient: i would say like you know a two or three like not very i do believe it very much right now because you know i not presenting and it just you and i not like a group full of people . so that pressure is not there here . therapist: so right now you really not buying the idea that you not good enough . patient: yeah that is correct therapist: so now let move to let say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there and the classmate that could be looking at you it could be negatively evaluating you because you worried about how much do you believe that thought then ? patient: i do feel really confident . in that moment . it feel very real . like like any moment they gon na kick me out . like i just not doing well . i stuffing . therapist: yeah . really intense . so would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what true or not . now or when you in that state of anxiety patient: definitely now that anxiety that you know heart rate and sweating is not there . therapist: so this evaluation the percent that you believe that true this evaluation is more accurate ? patient: yes i think so . therapist: and how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now or you can evaluate accurately ? patient: i would say you know when i not at risk of presenting like i feel like i spend the majority of my time like it not something i worry about all the time just leading up to and then mostly that day therapist: okay . so the so you able to evaluate the way you are now the vast majority of the time right ? there a limited amount of time when you not when there a lot of motion going through right ? and at those time you maybe a little le reliable patient: right . like my judgment is clouded . therapist: however in that moment you still those thought are strong right ? patient: yes very troubling . therapist: even though it a small percentage it intense . and you kind of carry that around a little bit . patient: yeah . exactly . therapist: so i can see why this is frustrating for you .",
            "the patient ha a larger fear over everyone judging them . the patient belief other classmate recognise their symptom of anxiety and may feel the patient doe not deserve the program . the patient ha had only one bad presentation in term of grade . but on the day of presentation they think of reason to mess up and are scared how they are going to speak in front of kid a a teacher in the future . the patient agrees a lot of their anxiety come from their thought and not evidence . the patient agrees if they were to advice someone else in similar situation they would assure the other person doing well and only the cumulative grade will be considered . the patient ha an anxiety in anticipation that something will happen . the patient agrees their evaluation is clear at other day when they do have presentation however they point out that the emotion are intense during the presentation and their judgement is clouded ."

patient: they did explain anything . the government never explains anything . they just do want me to understand what going on because they just want to keep me out of captivity . therapist: the government . do you have anyone specific ? patient: nope it the entire government entire government higher government . therapist: how long have they been wanting to do this to you ? patient: all my life . i done this all my life . they they always listening . they always around . they always there . therapist: always there ? patient: always there . like for example they in the light right now . they listening to everything that we talking about . so that the reason why i really ca talk about what happened on the bus because they just going to use that against and then it locked me up again . i think we take more minute . therapist: even taking medication . patient: yes i take the medication because if i do take the medication government come and take me away and put me into a hospital where they force me the medication . and then the light are always on and they can always hear everything that i saying and what i thinking and what i going to do . therapist: do you know what they want to do with that information ? patient: wanting u to take over the world to take over the world people in the world of course they want to use everything and use everything that everybody know to use it against them so that they can actually have the world they want in that baby and make everybody pretend that they do know what going on . so therefore they using everybody thought against themselves so that the government can use it to their benefit . therapist: so what can you do in a situation ? well you said the government monitoring everything and they want to put you in jail . if you do take your medication do have any option . are you stuck ? patient: no . so when i home i think i perfectly fine because i set up my house in my room to actually make it government proof so that nobody can actually hear see what going on in there . so when i home i perfectly fine . therapist: so one option is that being home being home you safe patient: being home and being home i saved my mom saved my brother save everybody safe . and being out in the world in the world . that a nobody safe . therapist: are you safe here ? patient: no i told you they are employed and they can hear everything that we saying right now . so no we not safe here . therapist: it just not safe here . it not safe out in the world . at home you safe patient: at home and safe in my room that i mean government . therapist: so if you could have your way you would you would stay home most of the time all the time ? patient: i would stay home all the time but i ca stay home because i mean to go and see doctor and talk to people and do the thing that the government need me or want me to do . but i do want to do those thing because she in my thought and they trying to use everybody and get sleep . i ca deal with that . therapist: so how how do you know that they in the light ? like how did you discover that ? patient: everybody know that they in the light . it common knowledge . it common knowledge . everybody know that . therapist: do you ever hear thing that other people ca hear or see thing that people ca see ? patient: no of course everybody hears the light talking to you . i do know what you talking about . like everybody hears it . sometimes it a whisper . for some people . sometimes it a yell . and if you want to not pay attention to what the light are saying to you then i do know what wrong with you but everybody can hear it . therapist: what the sound like to you ? patient: it sound like a robot talking . it sound like we need to know this information we need to what do you do . therapist: i just making some note . speaking some weird progress note doe that worry you ? patient: yes . where your note gon na go ? therapist: well this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall patient: who ha access to the chart room . therapist: mostly everybody work here . patient: can i get a copy of your note after you done ? therapist: doe it worry that there note ? patient: yes because i might trust you . and i do know if i do yet . but i do trust the other people who work here because i do know if they working for the government which they probably are working for the government . so they can actually have access to all of my note and the thing that you writing down which i do know what they are because you not going to give me a copy of it yet . and i just do trust that they can actually get that information and because they going to use it to their advantage and they going to give it to the government which i ca have that . so could you please not take note ? therapist: i could not take note what kind of information and note are you worried that the government gon na get ? patient: well because i made my room at home government proof i think they going to try to steal that technology when i actually create it so that they can then disrupt my room and then everybody else room who are just like mine so that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do the thing that they want me to do . therapist: so without the protection that your house offer they could control your mind . patient: correct . without my room and without the technology and the system and the thing that i created then the government will be able to control everything that i do . therapist: all right . so can you tell me about your mood through all this this sound really stressful you describing environment where the government frequently looking at what you doing for the feeling are you feel sad or angry ? patient: i feel fine therapist: you feel fine . patient: i do really have any problem yeah i just i feel fine . i do feel happy . i do feel sad . i just i just here therapist: kind of resigned the government gon na do this patient: well the government gon na do what they gon na do anyway . so it doe matter if i happy sad pissed off angry . any of that the government going to make me do what they want me to do anyway . so it doe matter how i feel . therapist: are you worried that something is going to happen a similar will happen on the bus ? patient: no because i learned my lesson to not say those thing out loud into to talk about what the government doing because i ca actually inform anybody else because nobody listening to me because they already controlled by the government because they do have a room like i do at home . therapist: to avoid that in the future because it did really it did really work . you were able to to help them understand what going on . patient: while people do understand what going on then that their fault . that their problem . they should have listened to me . and i could actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room so that the government ca hear them . therapist: but they were open to that idea . patient: no . quite the opposite . it is completely opposite . therapist: how are your family relationship ? patient: okay . yeah we live with my mom . she doe that she supposed to she doe go in my room because she know that . she go into the robot gon na mess up the technology so she stay out . therapist: so you get along through okay . anybody else you have contact with ?

patient: well he he think it all in my head . he he say it stress . therapist: right okay . um what do you think ? patient: well i mean it ca all be in my head . i hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head . i mean it real . it it a real pain . therapist: and if you had any thought yourself about what you think might be causing it patient: well i mean i did think that perhaps it wa an infection that had cleared up in the early stage . but i think i mean sometimes i think it ibs friend of mine got that and it sound similar . and then other time i think i wonder if it an ulcer on a really bad day i start to think it might be cancer therapist: right patient: my mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year and she had a growth the doctor did investigate that by the time they found it it wa the size of a football and it wa it wa too late to operate them . so you know when i go to bed at night now and i just feel and make sure there nothing different going on and yeah i worry about that . therapist: so you you kind of prodding having a feel at night just to see if you can feel anything . patient: yeah . so just want to make sure there nothing changing down there you know therapist: right . okay . okay . so just to make sure that i got the story straight you you seen dr . brown for couple of year you tried a variety of medication some prescribed some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference . you had some investigation but you perhaps feel you not had enough investigation . and time you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer . is that if i got the story right patient: yes therapist: barbara what wa it that you were hoping that i do for you today ? patient: well i thought you know you a new doctor here and you just finished your medical training . i wondered whether you know with new eye and new way of looking at at the problem . you probably know about different test and new test that my doctor doe know about you know new development that perhaps you could send me for some different test . therapist: right . right . so you hoping that i send you four more test ? patient: hmm . well i think this there got to be something that test might reveal . therapist: right . okay . well i think barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptom i not sure that actually sending you for more test at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you . and the reason for that is because you you had some of the main investigation in the last couple of year and they not shown anything . and you symptom have really changed that much . so it very unlikely that if we were to send you for more test now that they show anything different than what we already know . so it be i think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more test . patient: so it like do you think it all in my head that you going to be like dr . brown you think i imagining all of this ? therapist: no i think that you clearly have pain . and it clearly you have lot of physical symptom and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability . i guess the way i think about these thing is that they not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body . sometimes these thing can go together . i guess i thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptom seemed le and when your husband away which is something you do like very much . sometimes somehow his symptom then will seem greater . so i guess what i wondering barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel in your mind and what going on in your life and and how much you symptom trouble you . do you think that a possibility ? patient: well i ca see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain . therapist: i not saying that the pain in your mind . i guess what i saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our life are going can impact how we notice our symptom . given that we tried medication for you and we tried investigation and we drawn a blank really with those none of those have really helped you . i guess i wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problem . patient: what sort of approach ? therapist: well i guess thinking a little bit about those other area of your life . i thinking about the fact that over the last four year your life really changed . it seems to have been really shrunk down . and it sound a though you not doing lot of the thing that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of is that right ? patient: well i just ca do them . yeah i ca do them anymore . therapist: and i guess i wonder it sound a though you you dropped doing those thing because you felt you could do them . but i wonder if in a funny way what happened is the fact that you not doing those pleasurable thing now ha kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment . and i guess i wonder whether that can then make your symptom worse for you ? patient: oh i do know . therapist: i guess what i be wondering is whether one of the approach we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day . and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable thing . even if it just meeting up with your female friend once a week . and whether actually doing those sort of thing might generally improve your quality of life . i also thinking about the tablet that you taking . and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of these symptom worse i guess . what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three month just to see whether or not it make any difference ? patient: what two three month is a long time if there is something going on i mean that what happened to my mother in law you know they they left her and did spot it and therapist: well i guess if we if we did decide to work together like this this new approach i be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptom and if they change then we can investigate a appropriate proof they stay the same then you know we could be pretty clear that there nothing new happening that that we missing . how would that sound ? patient: so what are you saying then that i should come back and see you therapist: i think that would be a good idea . i think we only just begun talk about it . and i think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week . and that would give u a good chunk of time to think about this new approach . and perhaps if you could also bring your your tablet in or make a list of them . we can look at what you taking and perhaps go from there . how would that sound barbara ? patient: okay well to make an appointment for next week come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more . therapist: yes i think so . i think that would be a good a good start . patient: and i make a list of the tablet that i taking here and bring all the bottle down . therapist: okay . all right . okay . all right . so see you again next week patient: i make an appointment next week . therapist: all right . thank you barbara . patient: okay okay . therapist: bye bye",

            "therapist: are you doing today ? patient: okay how are you ? therapist: i doing well . thanks for asking . patient: yes um i would like to be able to kind of i been feeling a little depressed and i would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know the depression . therapist: so reduce feeling of depression . yes that be a cool okay . yes . so sound like a good goal . so what objective what task do you think that you could do ? that would help you to feel le depressed ? patient: i guess maybe some sort of physical activity maybe like walking . i like to be outside . so maybe walking could be one . okay . therapist: have you had a plan before we have walked regularly ? patient: you know i used to . i did . and it wa it wa it wa a it would give me some relief because i wa i wa able to clear my mind whenever i wa walking . and so i yes yes i had success with walking before . therapist: so walking ha worked before . patient: yes . therapist: and you notice that you walking le since you had a first impression . i patient: really have been doing too much of anything i just been kind of at home doing homework stressing out over doing getting homework done . because i you know back in school and it been so stressful and overwhelming . you know like i said it just kind of gotten me in this little funk this depressed mood . so therapist: since you on the topic of homework which is something you think you can do there you mentioned that it stressful and overwhelming . and that sound like the type of feeling that are related to depression sometimes . mm hmm . do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is ? patient: yeah because you know is there so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know several assignment . do and at the same time and i find myself rushing to get assignment and and you know it can just be a little daunting . it just overwhelming sometimes . so yeah . and i do know maybe if i spaced that out and you know took you know did some time management or something like that i do know to kind of help me therapist: feel like maybe you starting the homework late compared to when it due . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: that the feeling maybe of overwhelmed . patient: yes i would say that . therapist: so yeah you right . it sound like this is just an organizational thing right . so if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier and do it in small bit okay . instead of me waiting more or le the last minute right . that would reduce the mean likely i would think reduce some of the stressed feeling of being overwhelmed . patient: i sure it would you sure would . therapist: so one make that your sec objective then so you have the walking okay . and then you have trying to space out the homework . patient: okay that sound doable therapist: sound good . all right . patient: yes . therapist: what other objective might work ? patient: let see . therapist: that worked in the past for you . patient: you know it wa something that i enjoyed doing . and right now i feel like i not doing any of the thing that i enjoyed doing because i been so busy doing work doing homework so i think that would probably help . therapist: so it a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework patient: yes . therapist: it ha kind of come in the singing part fun for it sound like but also there a social component seems like patient: yes it is . it is . enjoy access to enjoy singing and you know i enjoy the people that i wa saying with and we will go and hang out together go to different you know like jazz club or event you know different band that were playing it you know it just be nice . it fun . i love music . so i love listening to it and i love you know singing . so making music . so that wa great . i think that would be a good goal . therapist: you seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing . patient: yes it i i just love it . i enjoy doing it . and i just have had a chance to deal with lightning . therapist: so far . this is justmaking the time . patient: yes yeah . yes . therapist: good . all right . so we make that the third objective . so we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently . and then singing and that that socializing it the company that that singing that great . so three objective is good . i try to get to four . if you have one . is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you associated with not feeling depressed when patient: i used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt . and so that two thing . the beach . i love the beach because it soothing . it company . and i my she just such an awesome person and she always pouring into me and i just love spending time with her . so she life down to pitch . therapist: yes she doe . okay so this seems like a good good objective to yes . so you suggesting maybe visiting her more often ? patient: yes . again just at home doing homework and i have gone to visit her in a while . and the thing is she only life like an hour away . so it not a it not right . no it not . so that like a you know a trip i could do on a saturday . take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be i think that will be helpful . therapist: so again kind of kind of getting away from the school stressor . just take taking a break from it for a day . yes . and then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with . good . good . all right . so i want to go through each one of these . and just make sure that we kind of meeting all the criterion for an objective which i think we can do but these are all specific which is good . do you feel these are all achievable ? these are thing you can do . i think so . yeah . yeah . well someone that knew done in the past right patient: right . therapist: so now we have the specific and the achievable . i do want to get too personal and more tricky which is making it measurable . i like to do here . i do want to be overly prescriptive in term of objective . i want you to decide . but i want to see we can quantify in some manner how often you be able to do these different thing or how you know quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but but first with the walking . so in a given week say what realistic for you in term of getting out and walking ? how many time ? patient: um maybe i can start out with twice a week twice quickly . therapist: okay . do you have two particular day in line day for your responsibility are too great . you have that opportunity ? patient: maybe we need to start with one day a week . therapist: okay . let go one day one time one time a week . let talk with one and then we see what happens . patient: okay therapist: so what day of the week are you thinking ? patient: about monday ? therapist: consider a window of opportunity you see on monday . patient: it is . yeah . plus it just kind of i think no no . how about wednesday ? therapist: wednesday ? patient: yes . wednesday middle of the week . stress from work and school and yes wednesday . sound good . therapist: once you have a particular time range you like to walk a few time a day patient: like . therapist: that a good time for you . a the time you can get out of house patient: yes off work . and give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door . because if i if i make it too late i not going to go therapist: is kind of a good that a good time . yeah . good . so we start with that objective . the walking every wednesday at for every amount of time are comfortable with . so the homework is a little trickier right ? this is about spacing it out . okay ? so the homework assignment they stressing you out . how much time did they take ? last few few question . how much time do they take to complete ? generally ? like an hour ? so patient: it depends on the assignment . therapist: if you had the average of patient: the average two hour therapist: let go to worst case let go two and a half hour just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case . patient: maybe it depends because therapist: when we get three patient: yeah the second therapist: two to three hour okay . and then how much time do you have when it assigned to when it due usually patient: maybe a couple of week . therapist: a couple week . yeah . patient: i get distracted . so a little distracted . so it you know i start reading and i fall asleep or i get distracted by something . and then before you know it the time is gone . and i rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done . therapist: so i wa ready to do the work to ease into the last okay yeah i could see how that would be stressful . what day of the week is usually a sunday . patient: on tuesday on tuesday . therapist: so you have tuesday and then you have another tuesday and the week after that you have three hour of work . and those two week . patient: shipping . okay ? therapist: yeah will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified wednesday that gon na be a walking time right right at the time and you can start the homework because the first time patient: i come back from my walk on wednesday . therapist: how long do you foresee patient: well normally only half an hour . therapist: so to get some time to decompress and round alright so from eight to nine on tuesday or wednesday on wednesday you get the first third of the homework . and then and then just stop . okay that be that be done for the night . okay . all right . that some big plan . how about that second hour ? patient: i get started . therapist: thursday so it just one day apart . patient: yeah that due thursday . therapist: oh do come thursday . yeah . an hour . yes . and what hour do you have in mind ? patient: thursday therapist: so but so one night wednesday be at nine . and then on thursday seven nine wa two hour . seven day . sorry . okay . so now just the last hour remains patient: sunday sunday therapist: through sunday . okay . so you you want to get everything done from tuesday to sunday night ? yeah the rest of that time off . yeah . okay . okay . sure that achievable . that seems like you you getting a lot in there but you think you can do it ? patient: i can try . okay . yeah therapist: that sound good . all right . what time sunday patient: sunday around five therapist: to five to six five to six . patient: yes . therapist: and i assuming it wo run over because we kind of have to be on the high side but if it did i would be able to go five to seven so that kind of like yeah flexible time there . yes . so what would that feel like to get your homework done ? patient: but it would be a relief . therapist: okay . so and there a potential backup plan i see in here is that if something happens on sunday where you need more time and you do want to stress you still have that wednesday after you walk bacon . yeah . so that could be like your your backup . yes that make sense . yes . because you still have another six day to have done after that . right . all right . so all those seem realistic and achievable . patient: it doe . therapist: every so many friday . patient: every friday therapist: so so this is this is every friday commitment . right this thing ? patient: yeah . but one friday is generally it maybe therapist: about two hour two hour . so two hour every friday . there something really enjoyed though . so and it sound like you look forward to it . yeah . so friday two hour i guess . yes . afternoon or evening . evening . okay . patient: yeah i mean if i if it wa something that came up that i really had to get done is not like i ca not go . so it wo be managed right ? therapist: yeah . good . okay . so that wa the last objective this is . this is i guess about a whole day commitment right ? because you go to the beach it an hour drive so you probably would want to go down for just a few hour . more like the whole day would they ? patient: that would be more like a saturday . but of course it would be every saturday . therapist: so how many time and say a month like once ? once a month ? okay . so you go down on saturday morning and come back ? patient: yes . therapist: that something to look forward to . yes . is that something that would be okay in term of like because on friday night potentially you be out . right and then saturday . patient: yeah if i if all those saturday that i know that i going i could not be out too late on that . therapist: okay that a good idea . so you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out ? yes . when you know that saturday is coming patient: or not go at all that fine . either way therapist: just take a break that time . yes . restore . all right . so that four separate objective . and what i want to do since i kind of made a lot of specific notation here i want to take a moment just take a break and print this up for you . okay we work on the rest of your goal next time but i want you to have this so you can get started on it right away . so before i print these up a a change you want to make patient: um i would like to try that therapist: and if it doe work can we tweak ? oh yeah we can always make change . maybe certain thing will work really well . it certain thing we have to take off the list altogether maybe substitute something else . yeah we can we can make edits to it the whole time you here . okay we can just make a document that change a a needed . but if you think it a good starting place i go and print this up a it is and give you a copy and we can resume with today session . and then next time i see in a week or call the rest of the treatment plan . beside the plan yes . thanks allison . patient: thank you .",
            "the patient ha felt a little depressed and wish to reduce those feeling . the patient ha been stressing out doing homework and walking ha helped them before to give some relief . the therapist clarifies organizing homework differently in small bit will help instead of last minute . the patient enjoys singing a it is a social activity . the patient also love going to the beach and visiting their aunt . the therapist work out a plan with the patient . the plan is to walk every wednesday at for the amount of time they are comfortable with . the patient would take three hour at max to complete their homework . the plan discussed is to do homework on wednesday right after the walk then on thursday and sunday . the patient agrees all those feel realistic and achievable . the patient also add a two hour plan on friday evening which is not every friday . the therapist finally add the whole day commitment to drive down to aunt place once a month on any saturday . the therapist document this plan and would review in the next session in a week ."

about a week ago ? okay so what been going on when that happened ? patient: um well i am going to have to go to courtsoon . and i know that i probably gon na have to go i like treatment or something like that but i really just do want to . so i just i just coming here becausei do know maybe i can like get out of it if i gettingsome type of treatment . but yeah therapist: get out of it . you mean get out of the charge ? patient: yeah . i mean i feel like they probably gon na make me like go to like rehab or something like that . and i do want to do that . therapist: so you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two . patient: i do know . i really am not sure . therapist: so at this recent arrest you realize it may be a value to stop using which really do want to yeah stuck there . patient: yeah kind of therapist: when you drink do you ever socialize the same time ? patient: i mean sometimes i like go to bar and thing like that but most of the time just like at my house therapist: alone so do the marijuana patient: yeah i mean i like a few people that are like smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself and myself every day so it wa with people therapist: so it doe sound like you really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing patient: um this this alcohol and i want to take it for pain relief quality yeah . therapist: any other reason um patient: it just easier therapist: forget about problem yeah . so affect your mood in a positive way . patient: yeah like i get like i like the feeling once i drunk therapist: have you use since you had to do it ? patient: um i have drank but i a a situation . therapist: so you have the use it take away pain for you to take swing xiety feel good . but then you have these consequence of the law . and you figure those two thing out . patient: i do know . i do know if there is what wa your wealth of knowledge . so like not a just therapist: you can imagine that . so it wa a good the other side . can you imagine having further it say law enforcement like more charge in the future . patient: i guess i had really considered that . therapist: so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charge or there not a really heavy consequence . and you be more careful in the future . patient: i do know . yeah i guess so . therapist: so with that thinking you continue to use a you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble . patient: yeah . therapist: first you have to get out of trouble this time . patient: yep . therapist: so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it ? patient: i just could imagine therapist: so there a social component here . patient: yeah a little bit . i drink mainly by myself just because all my friend work like nine five job . they do drink every day . but i do . but like on the weekend like all of my friend who i therapist: so even if you had no anxiety no pain you have to give up at least those interaction with your friend . how would they respond if you went out with them ? i did drink . patient: um they probably just like would understand it because we all go out and we get like really drunk and therapist: so it be socially awkward . straining the relationship with your friend . so the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doe seem like a good route for you patient: know . therapist: but then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it . patient: yeah i mean it making me think that like maybe i i need to like make a change . i just ca see that . that the change i making . so therapist: you need to make some change . yeah but not the alcohol . drug . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: something else could change . patient: yeah i do know what but therapist: so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal . would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain ? patient: am i just not going anywhere ever ? i might not drive a often therapist: so that strategy might not work . that something you been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little le . seems like all your option here kind of grim . yeah that just that just me doe seem that way to you too . patient: now that i like therapist: talking through it yeah . patient: i like do think i have any choice really therapist: have any choice ? what going to happen is going to happen ? patient: i do know . therapist: all right . so let start with the lead now . pick up with me now . you do want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a duo . what do you think you could do that would make a bad impression ? patient: um go to court drug therapist: i would do it . patient: get another duo in the meantime that wa not good either . therapist: so you want to avoid those behavior for sure . so you know for sure you do want to have sex ? would it be acceptable those thing anyway ? patient: i mean not really . i mean i think i should avoid doe not like drunk driving enough . or maybe not during the day of my court date therapist: so would you appreciate those skull like avoiding those situation i go in the court truck patient: yeah . therapist: goal that you could get behind patient: i mean i can try i guess to like think about it and charlie get out now i gon na be stressed out ate my court date . it gon na be hard to like not drink that day . therapist: you not striking me a overly enthusiastic about this idea . patient: now therapist: this is really tough for you is the outcome . the marriage law are important . yeah this whole this book do you i think it really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed . yeah . so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gon na change thing patient: i do know because i do know any other like way around it then just dealing with it . i mean if i like do go to court or anything that like a worn out for me like i ca i ca avoid this situation . therapist: but if there a condition of your treatment the judge say no more drinking is no more marijuana period . we can see that that if you obey those rule or word jail patient: now i could get to that . i know it possibly could probably well but i wa i do know . therapist: i would think it almost certainly would have happened . yeah . patient: i do know what i gon na do . therapist: back a couple of step . how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana ? patient: for about like six year six year . therapist: have you ever until now with the duo have you ever envisioned stopping ? now what your plan ? like pre d ? why wa your plan and all this ? patient: i just had dinner like the jerking kind of ha gotten worse . therapist: yeah . so without this or something you would have continued using ? patient: yeah i did really have any like therapist: until now . yeah . could this be a strange way like an opportunity ? patient: i mean i guess if i had if i wanted to stop by this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop . therapist: if you really wanted to stop because your stuff patient: i do know . therapist: you could give a shot . you just not sure you could . you could actually do it . patient: yeah i mean i never tried to before so i do know . therapist: it just unknown . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: so where do you want to go from here you have this to you i imagine a hearing or some type of coming up here to see me . what can i do to help you ?

            "therapist: how many time have you gone to work and made a mistake ? patient: i do know . i mean i guess none technically none that have been something i gotten trouble for anything like that . sometimes it hard to tell because you know you do always hear from people afterwards . you ca really tell wa it a mistake or not . but i guess none that it had like any major consequence . therapist: so none but there might be a few small one that you just never found out about . so le than a of a percent day you come in probably very small really really small . the probability of a statement that you making being true is pretty low . the seventh thought rather i going to make a mistake . probably not supported by the evidence . patient: yeah i guess that true . therapist: so the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful . i just got a couple strike against it . but it is the thought you having so let deal with it . i going to make a mistake . so what could you tell yourself a the first part of that adaptive response which acknowledges that fear that realistic that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake patient: i guess like it everybody make mistake . therapist: everybody make mistake . i could make a mistake today but it unlikely that that also be accurate . so everybody make mistake . i could make a mistake but it probably not gon na happen . rather than i going to make a mistake . so you going to have that automatic thought either way likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive response . so this is what we working on is your response . so everybody make mistake i could make a mistake probably not going to happen . and will could be a next part which is realistic but also positive . that can help get you past the reaction of being late morning . patient: i a good caseworker and i need to do my job so i can help other people and it going to be okay . therapist: okay so there a few few element in there . it going to be okay i need to do my the job i help people all those all those are true so applying a you know even a you say this year with me a you say it gon na be okay i need to my shop . what are we actually having right now ? patient: i mean it feel a little better but it hard you know so i felt still feel like it dangerous i might make a mistake but i guess it help a little bit therapist: can you see yourself being able to in the moment and i realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in . can you see yourself applying this self talk ? patient: yeah i think i probably will because now it will be hard to have those thought and not think of you . okay i need to calm myself down a little bit . therapist: and you already used self talk on your own before even knew about these ? patient: yeah . it did help in the past . therapist: a lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training . right just like many professional professional depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision . so think of this kind of like something you learned in the training . this is a self talk . it pre packaged it ready to go . you can even have it written down . okay ? doe have to be short . it can be like a paragraph or more if you want a a matter of following the protocol . once you have the automatic thought it easy to descend into worry and fear . you just looking too quick to grab a moment in there . apply this treatment strategy . doe that make sense ? sometimes it likely well most of the time i think you would you would be able to do this . sometimes you probably wo a important in those moment to not get discouraged . right . so you can have a self talk for that to write something like dr . crowley said it wa likely that once a while i would build do this . patient: it not gon na work every time . therapist: make sense ? patient: yeah that make a lot of sense . therapist: so it the chaos of life right in the chaos of emotion that sometimes interfere . the more time you have success that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptom but allow yourself failure . well it what i would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feeling and thought . there not gon na be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk . okay so be easy on yourself a soon a you can patient: that make sense because like if you could just flip a switch you i would only have to have one therapy session . therapist: it be good shape right ? so it a little more difficult than that . but overall this these strategy are fairly straightforward . and you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them . i want you to have that confidence . it it normal to have mistake occur . and to not always do it a you need to a you want to but in the end overall you should be able to be able to apply them and actually it get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thought . okay ?",
            "the patient had fear of making mistake . the patient fear to tell the mistake even he do that is mistake or not . therapist told patient about the self doubt the patient had like probability beign true is low in patient . therapist asks some question about patient condition while thought that he is going to make a mistake . the patient think everyone make mistake . therapist agreed to the statement but the thing is patient more likely to believe in it and patient think it going to be okay . therapist said there are some element are okay but still patient feel dangerous if he make mistake . therapist asked patient about self talk . patient practice it to calm himself but doe find very helpful . therapist suggest patient to stepback and follow the training for few day . therapist told to keep a note not short like a paragraph and read it . patient think it not gon na work everytime but therapist made him understand about this strategy to follow it ."

this is doe matter how my face i get this . constantly . yes . always there . therapist: okay i guess the reason i wa checking i think we picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kind of experience that you are they find if they take certain drug it could make thing feel a lot worse . i just wanted to check . that had been your experience . patient: no therapist: okay okay . appreciate from what you saying you really very worried about this conspiracy and that that the cause of the difficulty that you having at the moment . i just wanted to check with you do you think it could be due to anything else ? and i mean i obviously met other people who had similar experience and sometimes they extremely stressed some people might be mentally unwell and it worth it whether any of these thing might be relevant to you at the moment . patient: no because i not ill . therapist: alright . patient: it them and i read book on this a well . i do the government know about the them to know that they do this to load of people . i do know how they can get away with it . i have done nothing wrong i do know why they doing this to me . therapist: okay . sure i think i can appreciate that . i guess what i wondering is whether you think there anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you a a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful . do you think any of those thing would help you at the moment ? patient: i do know . i mean i want to hear really because someone warmer tried to . i do want to worry about i tried to talk to her about it . she doe understand she doe really believe me . i mean do you believe me ? therapist: well i certainly believe that you having a really difficult time at the moment i guess i not too sure about is what causing this and i i le sure this is due to is what i wondering is it perhaps you not a well a you might be at the moment . i mean we been through a lot of question and what i thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this someone drink cuz i know your mom is i think she waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of u can put our head together have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support . would that be alright if i got your mum in ?

            "therapist: so tommy i wanted to talk to you because i wa on facebook the other day and saw some picture from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because i saw you were drinking and i wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fit in your life . patient: i mainly just drink whenever i at party or whenever somebody hand me a beer i i take sip every now and then . but it not something that i feel hovers around my life . therapist: it kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority . yeah . how much do you think you drinking ? patient: i guess i would say like every other every other weekend maybe every every two week . on occasion maybe there a basketball game going on or a football game i have a beer just to drink with my boy . but other than that i do really see it a much of a of a problem . therapist: so you drinking maybe half the time depending on what going on that weekend . patient: yeah i guess you can say that . therapist: well how would you describe the difference between weekend when you drink versus one when you do ? patient: when i not drinking i usually more like involved in doing like more productive thing like i i try and do more schoolwork whenever i have the time or whenever i like i can go workout or something just to like when whenever i drinking i devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friend . okay therapist: so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekend . when do drink but maybe you do feel like you can relax a well . patient: yeah i mean i whenever i drinking i know that i devoting time to to not doing other thing . so i try and make it so that i do allow myself to pile on so much work . so i try and like get work done before but i know that drinking get in the way of productivity . so i try and minimize that a much a possible . therapist: you trying to be responsible and get your stuff done . yeah . knowing that the drinking is gon na make it harder . yeah . okay . and it sound like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink ? patient: yeah i guess when i drink some thing do slip a little bit . but just because like when i drinking i i not really focused on what i have to do . i focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that i have at that time . and it really something that i just it something of an like a pleasure giver like and enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing . therapist: what are the thing you enjoy about the drinking ? patient: just the way that it it sort of like liberates you and make you it make you feel like a more confident more energetic person that you do feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself . and it something that you it it just empowering to a degree . therapist: okay . so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some way ? yeah ? okay are there any not so good thing about drinking . patient: um whenever i drink too much i sort of lose control of myself and i i just like the aftermath of whenever i drank too much or whenever my friend mixed drink and it just ha a harmful effect on my body . that probably one of the major drawback that i had from drinking . therapist: what kind of thing happen ? patient: i mainly when when i puke or it just the the feeling that i get in my stomach if i drink too much is just very overwhelming . therapist: like you notice in your body how much do you think is the most you ever drank in one time ? patient: wow i would say probably patient: at a friend one of my friend had a birthday party recently . and he wanted to let loose wa it wa just the all the guy were together and they had a couple of friend over and it just turned into one big party and i just i lost it . i drank way too much i would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beer along the way . i got to a point where i lost count therapist: that wa out of the ordinary for you to discount what a more typical amount that you drink ? patient: i do let myself drink more than three or four beer on a given night . just because i know i i gotten to the point where i sort of know my limit . but i kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far i can go . and i think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire but i want to see how far i can go . just so i know not to go that far . therapist: got it . so you you sort of testing and pushing it in . yeah . and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequence that you mentioned . patient: yeah just so i know how it feel now so that later on when this the situation is more drastic and more out of control . i know what i can do and where am i limit is it you ? therapist: well kind of along those line looking ahead you know five year from now what do you see a a goal for yourself patient: in term of career wise in term therapist: of what do you think you be doing in five year patient: and i would love to be . patient: i would love to travel i would love to see the world for what it is . and i always seen picture and video of how the world is but i never really experienced that like i always wanted to travel to europe or or china or something or someplace like that . so i can really experience the world patient: that we live in . therapist: so getting a full experience is really important too . it sound like throughout your life you know you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience . and now you looking at how you can enrich your life in other way . how do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to it fullest ? patient: i guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effect of living life to the fullest . but i would want to tamper with drinking too much . like often just because i i know i seen the consequence that drinking ha on people and i know that i would never want to get to a degree where i need to drink constantly every single day . i do want to ever get to that point . therapist: okay . so just to kind of summarize what you told me so far you you drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drink maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you having some of these negative consequence . and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or le patient: yeah feel more in control therapist: and then kind of looking ahead . you do want to find yourself being someone who drinking all the time or someone who feel out of control with their drinking that you seen that maybe in other people life and it not appealing to at all . and and you do have some big goal for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with . so where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking ? patient: maybe now that i know my limit to an extent i kind of do want to push it . so so much . now that i know what i can do and where i can go . i would like to mitigate that a much a possible . i just want to i want to have fun being me . but i do want me to be influenced by alcohol . so much . like i want to live the sober life to an extent but i know that alcohol is just gon na tamper with it . therapist: so for right now it feel like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you you stopping three for example or maybe even limiting the number of time that you drinking . patient: yeah . and like not like not drinking like in the morning or just just strictly for social purpose like not just to not have it around like i do want to have it like in my fridge if my parent have it . i do want to i do want to have to deal with it . therapist: okay . what do you see a some benefit to that ? patient: benefit and therapist: sticking to those limit ? patient: i guess i could definitely be i could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like i could possibly be more productive more efficient in my work and where i can possibly be in the next few year of my life . and i think that by not drinking i will definitely have a better effect on my life . therapist: yeah i think taking step to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea . and i really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question . you know if you do mind i would like to talk to probably about this in a couple week or a couple month and just kind of check in how thing are going . right . all right . sound good . patient: thank you very much .",
            "the patient drink beer whenever they are at party . they drink every other weekend whenever there is a basketball or football game . the patient doe not drink when they have productive work to do and let loose completely on day they drink . but not so good thing is the patient ha become sick by mixing drink and also by losing control and overdrinking . the patient three to four beer are acceptable on a given night . the patient feel crossing the limit is drastic and more out of control . the patient life goal is to travel to the fullest . the patient agrees to limit drinking to three beer and restrict only to social purpose . the patient wish to be more productive and efficient at work in next few year of their life . they understand not drinking will have better effect . the therapist schedule another session in couple week or couple month ."

            "therapist: except that when you in work you worry a lot about how you come across in social situation . patient: yeah really make me feel really anxious . like what i look like and what people are thinking . therapist: yeah you said that you worry that you visibly shake . patient: yeah . therapist: and are there any other thing that you worry that people will notice ? patient: i think obviously the shaking i think my hand and leg shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking great . went ahead . therapist: so it sound like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you in these social situation . yeah . you say you go read you shake . is there anything else that you think that you do ? i mean describe yourself . how do you think you look when you in these situation just patient: like i think i just looked really obviously weird and out of place and like really read and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people . therapist: and is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these thing to manage these problem ? patient: and i guess like when i holding the camera i just grip onto it really really tight or kind of clench on my muscle and just find something that i can focus on . and to kind of try and make myself shake le and not go red and stuff . therapist: so you focus on something you grip onto that camera . do you make eye contact with people ? patient: no . i just tend to just look down . therapist: okay so you also avoid eye contact ? is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating for example patient: i just a i like kind of looking down and like wearing all black so it le obvious and what kind of worrying ? yeah just more layer and all black say you just ca tell . therapist: okay therapist: what do you think would happen if you stopped doing these thing ? if you stopped gripping onto the camera ? or you know you start to make eye contact and not looking down ? and what do you think would happen ? patient: i think it would be so much worse . yeah i think i just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously kind of weird and out of place . therapist: and what i thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thought on what would happen if you stopped doing these thing ? if we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work okay ? and if we did this maybe twice and the first time you do all the thing that you normally do okay and grip onto something look down . and is there anything else that you do when you in these situation these work conversation to try and cope . patient: and i just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clench whatever whatever it is i holding just really tight and just make sure i do make any eye contact at all just kind of get through it . therapist: okay so in the first time i want you to do those thing a much a you normally would in fact maybe even slightly more than you normally would . patient: okay therapist: and then the second time i want you to drop doing those thing all together . patient: okay therapist: doe that sound okay ? patient: try my best . therapist: and do you ? how would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like ? patient: okay . therapist: do you have a camera with you that we can video on ? patient: yeah . and there is my phone . okay . therapist: yeah yeah we use that in just a sec . patient: okay therapist: before we do this then we just going to fill out this form is because what we doing now is an experiment . we call it behavioral experiment see what happens when you change the way that you behaving ? patient: right . okay therapist: so the first column say i need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work and who should i play if you playing yourself in this roleplay ? who should i be ? patient: maybe like a client at work ? i always have to sit down with client before we did the shoe and kind of get to know a little bit more about what they want . therapist: okay so would it work if i wa maybe having a wedding and i wa hiring ? patient: yeah therapist: wedding photographer ? patient: yeah . therapist: what kind of problem do you see coming up in this conversation that we have like what we see yourself doing on camera patient: i am shaking like being really obviously shaking and okay bright red and okay so therapist: visibly shaking . so how how much will you be shaking if is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all ? how visibly shaking will you be ? therapist: okay . so what wa the other thing that you just said ? patient: like i really read therapist: okay so go read . patient: yeah . therapist: and how read will you go ? i mean if we look around this room patient: probably like the chair . therapist: okay thanks . hello . yeah you going to be a kind of brightly pink a these chair . oh yeah . okay . so out of then how how pink would you say these chair are patient: have okay . therapist: what else you worried is going to happen when we have these conversation just patient: worried to be fake like say something stupid and not be able to kind of get what i trying to say across properly . therapist: okay and how stupid out of is ridiculously stupid . patient: probably like similar . okay i say therapist: wow see worried will happen when you have this conversation . what else might you see on the camera ?

slightly worse like twice a bad ? patient: twice a bad . okay . yeah . therapist: okay therapist: right . can you give me your phone number ? patient: oh yeah . should i just use this ? therapist: and yeah yeah it probably best . okay . patient: okay . therapist: okay . so therapist: i wa just wondering if i could talk to you about maybe doing my wedding patient: photography . yeah . and what kind of kind of what kind of thing you see and how you want it to be like therapist: i suppose i like lot of shot of our family and our friend quite a lot of natural shot . you know talking when they having drink . and patient: yeah . do you want it ?

patient: i would like pound pound . i mean i would like more but i i tried to do more in the past and i do even get past couple of day . so i can do that would be great . therapist: right and you tried before ? and what do you think got in the way ? patient: i do know . i guess it wa convenient . you know . therapist: yeah . patient: just like something always get in the way you know and then i lose focus . i not very good at staying focused on stuff like that . therapist: loss of focus . so you start trying to lose the weight and your focus get disrupted . patient: and i forget and then i make you know spaghetti casserole for six people and then i eat a lot of it and that carbs and cheese and fat and then i you know will eat with my kid do eat and then it just like i forget that i supposed to be making healthy choice . therapist: alright so you know how to lose weight . and you know you can lose weight . but your focus is a little off when you trying and that causing the problem . could we break that goal of losing pound down into smaller unit ? like say five pound patient: do you think ? therapist: it just something you can do . patient: i am so busy therapist: for once a week . patient: i probably do once a week therapist: you mentioned the loss of focus is one problem . how about motivation you feel motivated to move through all those step like five pound and five pound and so on . patient: right now yes . i think i would need something to keep me going . you know week to week therapist: a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated . patient: yeah . like when your kid doe their homework early you can give them a special treat for dessert like that help you know keep it going . therapist: okay . so some sort of activity or item that you enjoy that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five pound patient: i would love i mean i just been so embarrassed you know therapist: all right . do you have the activity or item in mind ? we could put in place a something you could reward yourself with ? patient: like after the first five pound ? therapist: well there a few way we could do it . we could do that . so you reach five pound . and then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day . if that day you successful in eating the way you want he would you think would motivate you more ? patient: maybe something every day . therapist: yes you know each and every day a you trying to lose weight . you aware . when that day come to close if you had a successful night they were a le than successful day right ? if you have a successful day then you could engage in an activity or receiving item that we work out in advance that you know would motivate you . right ? patient: and that could be you know maybe watching like a favorite tv show . okay you know because i do watch tv at night because i so busy cleaning up and everything . maybe i could just take some time for myself because i did something good . you know i just watch a tv show . therapist: so let let do that . on a day you know towards the evening . when you know you have had a successful day and by what time would you know in the evening ? patient: probably a i preparing dinner if i prepare food dinner or if i prepare fun food for my kid but i do eat it like chicken nugget and french fry and stuff . therapist: let say some okay say so by at that point in term of the day being successful or le than successful you know okay right at you aware . and at that point if you have met your call then you have a you have a tv show that you maybe it recorded on a tv or something you would watch okay ? and if you were not a successful you would write . so i be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show . right ? a lot of fun . do you think that structure that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful day so it process ? patient: i do know honestly but it would probably be the way right now therapist: and this is something you could also track . right ? you could write down day that are successful day or lesson le than successful . and we could look at if there any pattern maybe weekend are harder because they easier or something where we can identify day that have maybe more trigger or we le motivated . patient: yeah i did think about that . because right every day would be different . therapist: okay there the potential for every day to be different with what you exposed to and what temptation in term of different food what your schedule like maybe for busier thing easier . so we can we can look at those different pattern . and we can add level to this plan . okay but for now we go with the tv show that you watch sometime after seven seven you evaluate how you did sometime after that . watch the show okay ? that like a plan . patient: so that leading up to the five pound . right ? right . okay therapist: day by day okay this and five pound increment okay four time to get to your goal . pound . okay . sound good . so far . so we give that a shot . and we take a look at the pattern that emerges support everything . i say write everything down . okay probably at around seven is a good time . when you know kind of day ahead write down kind of what happened that day and whether you had success or not . and bring that in . i see you again week . so give u i give you seven seven day to work with . okay ? and we look at that log of event . and we reevaluate each week . patient: so i could start tonight therapist: start tonight okay . patient: all right . therapist: so we give that a shot and i see it a week . patient: okay thanks kevin .",

            "therapist: i saw the thing that your name is elizabeth and i not sure if that what you go by patient: i mean liz would be the best . therapist: all right great . so this one of the thing i wanted to talk with you about is i know that you did some assessment over the last couple of day . and so i want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how thing are going to go . and based on that sound like the what from what you were saying in term of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder it called bulimia nervosa and i not sure if you ever heard of that . patient: i mean a little bit yeah . okay . therapist: so what i want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit . so what you talked about wa that there are period of time when you have when you have eating episode where you eat like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you lost control and you feel you know like overly full me vomit and the this happens fairly regularly . and there are time to when you you know you maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight . and that feel familiar to you . yeah . so and then it sound like that been going on for quite some time at least you know two three sometimes even upwards of five time a week . patient: i i say yeah . all right . therapist: so just want to let you know to about about that that it not unusual . for a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this . in fact we see upwards of of woman and call on college campus who struggle with that and even more upwards of who have you know kind of what we would call kind of variant of that in term of excessive dieting and some may even like throw up or use laxative or excessively exercise so it not unusual . one of the thing we know about blaming nervosa is that for a lot of woman it really start by excessive dieting . so like going for long period of time without eating and sound like that that wa something that you endorsed a well that there are time when you kind of diet excessively . yeah patient: especially when i wa younger . therapist: one of the thing that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know stop eating a lot or go for you know a day and a half and really restrict their calorie that oftentimes that that kind of lead into that kind of binge eating cycle . and we know that that the case . the other thing that we aware of is that a lot of individual who struggle with eating difficulty like this also report a lot of difficulty they have like with managing stress or managing relationship or have a difficult time knowing what they feeling or managing feeling . is that something that you experienced ? okay . yeah . all right . well that okay . because in many respect i think both thing go on for individual that struggle with eating difficulty like that . and so we know that there a lot of dieting and restriction that go on but we also know that there are other thing that are happening in term of managing feeling managing stress etc . so one of the thing that i like to focus on in term of working with client and working with individual like yourself is i take an approach it called interpersonal psychotherapy and and what that mean in essence is that i like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context because there a lot of thing that are probably going on or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with time and you been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake . and so what i like to do is really talk with you over the next you know few session about you know period of time in your life currently and in the past where you had you know overeating episode and when you restricted your calorie when you you know lost weight or when you you know binge and thing like that and really start looking at you know pattern perhaps in your relationship and then what we do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goal to help you reduce your binge eating . so how that sound ? okay . and there really good evidence for the thing you know the thing that we going to be doing in fact the more that we work on some of these issue you you know pretty quickly that you gon na start feeling a lot better and and it have a you know pretty positive impact on your eating . okay great . so this is what i like to do is first of all first of all let start with i want you to give me a recent episode where like just recently within the last couple day where you had one of those episode that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control and that you ended up vomiting or you know and and it will and kind of get an idea about that . and then what i like to do is and we go kind of back in time and then i want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that . so and then then what we do then over the next couple of session is then we we start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present . and i just ask you a lot of question and we you know kind of go from there . right ? so why do you tell me the tell me like a recent episode that where you felt like that you lost control . you eating patient: me like just this saturday night i guess . i went out with my friend . and it wa fun . it wa a good night at first and whatnot . and we then went to a party . i guess guess what kind of sparked it would be i saw the sky that i kind of liked for a little while and i mean i just wa i wa a little nervous about kind of what i wa wearing and it just did feel that good to see him . so i kind of left pretty early on and went home or back to my apartment . and yeah i mean kind of what typically happens is the kitchen grabbing different food bag of chip . i think my roommate had left out like a sleeve of cooky or something and and i just ate on the couch . yeah . finished most of it and yeah . therapist: okay . did you been restricting your your food ? you know for the prior to that or you been dieting prior to that ? patient: i mean i guess like dieting is what you would consider it a i try to eat more healthy typically . and yeah i mean i been like dealing with different assignment and stress around that . so yeah it kind of fluctuated time . okay . okay . therapist: i meant to tell you to i like to take a lot of note at least initially so i have a good sense of what going on . so what else wa going on ? okay so it sound like saturday night out with friend . see person that you like that you just say you dated some ? patient: i really like we kind of been like okay interested . interesting . yeah . therapist: okay . all right . i sorry . okay so you kind of interested . yeah . and then you sound like what you were then you began to feel more concerned about how you were how you looked at how your outfit felt . yeah . patient: i mean i did plan on seeing him right now . yeah yeah it just it wa yeah the right outfit to see . therapist: okay . and so that then then what then what happened then is that you go back to the apartment food there . and then you kind of sat down on the couch and you felt like that you lost control . patient: yeah . and then i guess after that like before bed i made sure . okay . go into the bathroom . okay . therapist: okay . it just kind of a typical scenario . patient: yeah . i mean yeah eating before . okay . therapist: okay . and then um so you went home to the apartment . patient: your junior year . so my third year therapist: in school and what are you working on ? patient: at english is major ? therapist: yeah . because i wa thinking about the time of the year so coming up or any project coming up so anything big on the horizon for you ? patient: i mean like midterm therapist: okay . okay . okay . patient: ah yes studying for one of my midterm and like on thursday night my test wa on friday and my roommate kind of ha had her boyfriend over a lot . and it pretty annoying because like she knew i had a test to study for and like i like being home to study . i do want to i do want to be in the library . like i want to be in my room and my bed and they constantly in the living room on the couch . and yeah they pretty loud . so it kind of frustrating and yeah it pretty stressful . okay therapist: sound like it . um what your roommate name ? patient: kathy therapist: kathy . okay . okay . so then kathy ha a roommate over quite often this last week she wa they were there quite a bit boyfriend her boyfriend . okay . and then you trying to study and did you talk with them about that in term of the noise or that bothering you ? patient: i mean she knew i had a midterm coming up . okay . okay . therapist: sound like you feel like that you tried to let her know in various way that you know you got something coming up and that you like to study and when it quiet and you like to be able to focus but that the sound like that . they kind of constant commotion is really distressing to you right ? if you talk with her like one to one about how that bother you or that that a real problem for you . okay she know what hard about doing that in term of talking with her . patient: i mean we kind of like newer roommate each other we were introduced . so we have known each other . therapist: okay . all right that make sense . okay . patient: i mean he ever alive . therapist: okay . okay . okay . all right . okay that helpful . patient: yes middle school so or eighth grade probably or ? therapist: middle school or year old . um good . so we start from there . tell me about your . tell me about your parent . patient: so my mom lisa she my dad is steve . they actually got divorced when i wa . okay so she then remarried soon after . okay . therapist: okay so your mom and dad divorced when you were . okay and so alright so let me okay that helpful . and then you say your mom got remarried . patient: two year after that . okay . okay . therapist: you have any sibling ? patient: i do now from this from her second marriage . therapist: okay . all right . and is that a boy or a little sister ? what her name ? brooke . okay so mom remarried . what your stepdad same ? bruce . bruce . okay . okay . all right . so mom and bruce . they have a little girl and her name is brooke . okay how old is brooke . okay six . oh she six . okay . okay . all right . okay . patient: i mean like after or what led up to that therapist: kind of do you have a sense about what led up to the divorce or what wa going on ? patient: i guess they were fighting a lot . yeah probably that those are probably my most memorable memory . yeah that a fighting and dad just they were around each other a much anymore . and mom wa kind of out of the house more . therapist: okay . then then . so then they divorced when you were . and so then how soon after did your mom marry a bruce ? patient: just under two year therapist: under two year . okay . how wa that for you to have her remarry so quickly ? patient: i mean they really like it . yeah . okay . therapist: during the during that period of time because i know you talked about middle school but during the period of time when they were having difficulty with their marriage . what wa your you know your eating like ? or how are you managing that during that time in term of your feeling about the night ? ah . patient: i mean i guess i do really recognize too many issue right then necessarily . therapist: were you talking to anybody or you know anybody ? reasonable . did anybody else know what wa going on ? or ? patient: i mean i wa like pretty close with my grandma my dad mom . okay . therapist: and she wa aware of what wa happening . patient: yeah she wa . yeah . so she wa definitely there . okay i closer with my dad . i say . therapist: okay even at that time and sound like that . you pretty close to you pretty close to your dad mom . patient: yeah . she not around anymore . but yeah . therapist: oh i sorry about that . when did she pas away high school . okay so alright so make a note of that okay all right so yeah definitely make sure that we talk a little bit about that okay so at mom and dad divorce le than two year your mamrie mary mary bruce so then what happened what happened to you after the divorce did you were you with your dad with with you patient: know with my mom more we moved to a different area okay not too far from my dad i saw him like a decent amount but definitely wa with my mom more therapist: okay so then you alright so then bruce your mom and bruce in the you because i know you seeing more time with her moved to what like a different different town different patient: i just like a town over okay but change school and whatnot . therapist: okay . all right . so prior to moving to a new school were you in a public school or private school patient: is a public school then switch to a private therapist: switch or private school ? okay . okay . all right . okay . how wa that transition for you going from public school to private school ? patient: i mean i wa excited about it . it wa kind of like a more uppity area . yeah i mean like it wa kind of hard because they like like in a private school these people have kind of been together for a little while . and because there le people there they kind of moreso all know each other and have their group and whatnot . therapist: okay . and so then that would have been in around the time when you were when you made that move . okay so then sound like to that that wa the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating . patient: yeah i think i like started . mate and i felt like more pressure from my mom . she wa very vocal . towards me about my eating and my look and whatnot . therapist: oh that you felt when you say pressure from her in what way ? were she pressuring you ? patient: i mean like she wanted me to look good . therapist: okay . like what say that you would fit in more or okay . okay okay doing patient: hair . yeah . okay . therapist: and it sound like what you were saying wa that we ask you how you felt . and you said you you said you were excited . you were excited . like i wa excited but so doe mean so did that mean that you were sound like if you were happy ? patient: happy let them know that i did like the school . therapist: okay . and then what when you would do that what would be the risk patient: i just like oh you should feel lucky . like it good school . okay . therapist: okay . well so many way like one might be putting word your mouth but what like kind of get over it or like deal with it or okay . so and so then you were feeling pressure from her sound like also to that you were really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wa a much concern about your feeling about where you were . wa there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in term of like kind of the get over it ? you know that ? patient: i mean you mean in term of the schooler ? my body ? therapist: no you in term of the school . patient: i mean like get over it like it will get better with time . like you just have to put yourself out there to meet people . therapist: okay . all right . so that kind of pressure . yeah . and then you said that you did really like bruce what kind of person wa a man ? what wa making you not like him so well ? patient: i mean he just kind of like a sketchy guy . okay . therapist: oh so that maybe that there wa something going on between bruce and your mom prior to the divorce ? yeah . sorry to hear that must have been really hard . yeah . and were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time ? yeah . okay . like were you ? i mean how what wa the arrangement where you spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom ? patient: yeah . so i said my mom during the week and i got to my dad like every other week . okay . therapist: okay . so then given the fact that in case you were happy in school you said that it wa more kind of an uppity school private school . kid wa it a mixed school or wa it like an all girl school ? yeah mix school and that kind of clicky sound like and then your mom really sound like she really wa pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better . so when in this process did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge thing like patient: dieting it definitely i guess like eighth grade ninth grade . and that definitely came from like my mom thinking were telling me that to look a certain way to knit yeah and then there were time like like there wa unhealthy food around the hospital debris seat . mm hmm . and is there an accessible at time like i would eat that i would say for the most part i would try to like really restrict myself to okay . therapist: okay . and do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting a a way to kind of like manage the overeating ? patient: i mean just like pressure of starting high school and i in a same school same people and i really wa happy hard to make friend . i do know when i guess i heard from some of the other girl about like vomiting a like an option right that they heard some of their friend talk about before . right ? right . yeah so okay . and like the dieting even though if i wa eating healthy i would still hear from my mom like oh like you need to look like this right ? here this outfit i want you to wear but you ca wear it like if your body like that . therapist: so she wa really critical of how you looked . okay okay so then what wa that ? what did that do ? let me take a step back . so it sound like that . you always been a little closer to your dad . so then what wa the divorce and the move and some of that transition ? what effect did that have on your relationship with your mom ? patient: i mean i do even really remember like a really good time with my mom . therapist: okay . okay . all right . so the two of you do get along a well . okay . did it wa it getting ? wa it kind of the same during that time ? or wa it getting worse ? patient: i mean i guess i wa getting more vocal towards her and speaking my mind more . therapist: okay . all right . and then she wa then coming back more harshly and more critically . okay . all right . okay . well it not unusual . i mean a couple thing certainly not unusual for you know girl at that age you know in term of like kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of you know with eating and diet you know binge eating and dieting and vomiting . so it sound like that that wa kind of in some respect part of that culture . but it also sound like that there you know in term of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way . it almost sounded like that that she wa saying that you were like what ? you were too heavy for a particular outfit . and so then i sure that that do you remember how that wa feeling to you at that time when she would say thing like that ? patient: today ? yeah i felt like nothing i could do . right . right . yeah . therapist: all right cut of trump . did you talk to anybody about that ? did you talk with your dad about that ? or ? patient: it like no not really . okay . we have . therapist: okay . so you kept a lot of those feeling to yourself . okay . all right . okay well that that that helpful . let kind of let kind of hang on to that because we got a couple thing because obviously i think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school . also sound though that also during that time that you obviously you did have a very good relationship with bruce to begin with . and that your relationship with your mom wa kind of deteriorating . yeah . and then i know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in in high school but during that time like you know eighth or ninth grade did you have more contact with her ? were you able to like patient: connect with her on that a much a i could ? she also i mean she did live in that where i wa living . like when i would see my dad like occasionally we got therapist: okay okay . okay um patient: i mean like i love we really close and i love her . but a well a training so a an only child and then your mom get remarried and soon after a new baby and others also like my mom and stepdad like they both worked a lot . and so there also like i wa kind of looking after brooke got okay . okay . therapist: okay so then right ? so not only did where your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating then all of a sudden she pregnant she delivers . you have a baby sister . they working . and now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her but now you also feeling the pressure to take care of a baby sister . okay . okay and so during that time you feeling what ? patient: ah i just have you know a lot of weight on my therapist: okay . emotional weight on your shoulder . yeah . yeah . yeah . and then and then what wa your eat so then that would have been like you know the year like maybe to when you were more active . involved with that . what wa your eating ? like during that time ? patient: i mean i guess kind of similar to like what i described kind of now . i mean i like try to eat like super healthy right ? but then at time like especially because there wa food available . therapist: so were you binge eating more during that time then ? patient: yeah and i mean because i kind of found other way to make up for the binge eating . therapist: okay . all right such a throwing up so vomiting . okay so then that that kind of began to that started during that particular time . okay . all right . that yeah . okay . that really helpful to get that . patient: um i mean i guess i try to keep in touch with friend from my old school is tough because they all have new friend . and i met a few people . like nothing i know and i really open to but i mean i have a couple friend . therapist: okay um did anybody get anybody like emerges like like a best friend or a really good friend during that time or ? patient: i mean i just went to my friend from like when i wa really young . therapist: okay and what her name ? patient: is julia . therapist: julia . okay . so do you enjoy ? did you enjoy and still kind of maintain contact during the time ? yeah . yeah . did julia know what wa going on with you ? are you did you ever talk with her about kind of like the stress you were under ? patient: like she knew i did like my stepdad and that brooke being born right . therapist: so if she wa one person that you could kind of confide in a little bit . did she know about your the struggle you having with your ex with your binge eating no like . patient: okay yeah like we never really talked about it . okay . and you like she knew like my mom like put a lot of pressure . okay . therapist: all right . okay that helpful . so so julia wa and then kind of a source of support for you during that time . and also sound like your grandmother wa but then you also mentioned early on that your grandmother died in high school . okay and so that when did she pas away ? okay when you were okay . what wa that like for you when she died ? yes . patient: yeah i mean a lot . and then like my mom for some reason did want me to go to the funeral . like i do even know why um because she doe like me being like so connected to my dad family . therapist: i sorry about that . patient: yeah . so there is kind of like an argument there . about going to the funeral and they had my dad get involved . therapist: and so did you were you able to eventually go ? okay . all right . patient: give me even more just been like the fight with my mom . therapist: okay . all right . so during that time when you were arguing you notice more okay . all right . okay . all right . so okay that helpful . patient: i mean that wa well actually seen before that my mom and bruce actually also got divorce . therapist: oh okay so alright so then patient: a i got like surprised the like middle of senior year . therapist: okay so in the middle of your senior year then your mom and bruce get divorced . okay . all right so mom and first divorce . okay what wa that time like for you ? because then obviously then brooke is then she about two year old right ? no no no she before . okay she four year old . okay . okay . so what wa going on ? patient: i mean i never really got close to bruce . but i would say the only hard part would have been like kind of figuring out with broke because i wa really i mean i feel like i raised her . yeah that tough . and it just like frustrating that like my mom off my dad and then get married and then divorced dad therapist: right ? yeah . yeah . yeah . and so then what did that do to your how did that impact your relationship with your mom after you know in around the divorce ? patient: i mean we were still arguing . okay a lot . therapist: okay . all right . patient: she like kind of like started like trying to say sorry like feeling bad for certain thing but like it wa not again it feel like it wa sincere . therapist: okay so it almost a though that no she did have anybody and she wa you felt like that . she wa kind of like trying to reach out to you like mike almost like too little too late or okay . so then you know continued sound like continued kind of like anger and frustration with her . and then did did you notice any change in your eating during that time ? patient: i mean a excited hard to leave rock but like definitely excited to get out of the house like really tremendous thing . something new . okay . yeah it good .",

patient: i think it probably about six month basically . therapist: okay . and can you remember what happened to start it all off ? patient: well i think we have had some problem at work . and i felt more stressed about work than i normally do . and basically i wa just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it wa very hot very funny hot day and it just happened . my heart just started . to race and race and race and i could get my breath i wa just like gasping for breath . then i start to get chest pain and it wa just awful . and i managed to sit down and call my husband and he he came out he actually left work to come and get me . therapist: right . so that sound like quite an unpleasant experience . patient: it wa awful it frightenining yeah therapist: and when that wa happening to julie when you in the middle of town what wa it that you thought wa going on ? patient: i thought i wa having a heart attack i so afraid that that is what happening . therapist: right okay . patient: so you know start to try to avoid situation where i might get like that they see ya . therapist: so what kind of thing are you finding yourself avoiding ? patient: i ca get into town now without my husband taking me my husband ha to take me to from work . and then i also thought i should do anything to put any strain on my heart at all . so i do do much exercise or anything at the moment or other thing a well therapist: and other thing what sort of thing you are not doing ? patient: personal thing personal thing . therapist: okay . i guess i wondering if you talking about your sex life there . patient: yeah . therapist: right . patient: now i just feel you know that i should do anything like that because it just might put too much strain on me . therapist: so you avoiding sex in case that put your heart rate up . patient: yeah yeah therapist: okay how that affecting thing between you and your husband ? patient: my husband getting really fed up with it to be honest . he been really really kind and really supportive . but i think it starting to affect his life quite a lot now . so he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that i would because i begun to stop wanting to go out because i so afraid it gon na happen . i promised and promised him i go to the pub . and then when it came to it i just could . i just sat on the sofa and it started happening again . and then i wa worried that if i went to the pub i actually like get ill in the pub . and then it really embarrassing for everybody . so just that i could go in and i think he getting a bit to the end of his tetanus because it just seems to come out of the blue . and i never suffered from anything like this before . therapist: it sound like he getting to the end of his tether because it also sound like you pretty fed up with the whole thing a well . julie patient: yeah right . yeah yeah . therapist: so just so that i got the story straight . this all began about six month ago . before that had you had anything like this ? patient: no not at all . i mean i think we had a new manager at work i work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much stressful for all the staff not just me . and that i can sort of see that i wa in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me . therapist: so just to make sure i got the right the right way around . it began six month ago pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attack . and then since then you had some more and now it kind of got to the point that you do want to go out to do get to town by yourself . patient: no i do want to risk it to be honest . therapist: you know you do go to the pub not socializing like you used to and you avoiding thing like exercise and thing like sex and having a bit of a taking it toll on your relationship . patient: yeah yeah yeah . therapist: okay . okay . and looking at your i know you had an ecg dr . jones organized for you a couple of month ago . patient: yeah therapist: what have you been told about the result of that ? patient: well dr . jones said that it wa okay . and there were no problem . and you know i did feel relief you know because obviously there been event in my family my dad died of one you know . so i thinking it must be my heart . there must be something wrong with it right now . it did feel pleased when dr . jones said that . but on the other hand nothing changed . you know i still getting exactly the same problem . nothing you know not getting any help with it . i just feel a bit like well so i have got a bad heart according to the expert but i still getting all the same symptom you kow worse and worse . therapist: so even though the your gp told you there no there nothing to worry about with your heart . do you still worry that there might be something wrong with your heart ? patient: i ca understand it . what do you think of dr . julia ? therapist: i think i agree with dr . jones . i do think there is anything wrong with your heart . the reason i say that is that you had an ecg which ha come back perfectly normal . and usually if there wa a problem with the heart the ecg would pick something up . also you got none of the risk factor really for heart disease because you you do smoke your blood pressure from what i can gather from you note ha always been fine . you fairly young . before this you were pretty fit and active . and also i know you worried about your dad having had a heart attack but actually he wa a lot older than you are . and so you not really in the same risk sort of bracket a he would have been . patient: right . therapist: so i do think that there is a problem with your heart . i guess what i what is weather actually what going on is a little bit more what dr . jones thought weather actually this this might be the anxiety that giving you a lot of these symptom . have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem ? patient: i think i been thinking more recently it could be because my friend ha like panic attack . i discussed it with her and she said to be honest it just sound like that . i always thought it wa my heart . and what i ca understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is . therapist: it right . okay . ha anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attack ? patient: i do really know . therapist: okay well perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that . what we have on top of our kidney is two little gland and they called our adrenal gland . patient: right . therapist: and they produce a hormone called adrenalin . have you heard of that ? patient: yes i have heard of that therapist: okay . and what adrenalin doe is it prepares u for situation of fight or flight ? is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school ? patient: i do . i do . yeah . i do therapist: you remember what we mean by fight or fly ? patient: i think like if you in a scary situation you fight or you run away basically your body sort of trigger that . therapist: yeah patient: to do it . therapist: yes exactly . it what released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline . so when your body need to get ready to do something it surge out a load of adrenaline and the adrenaline basically get you ready for action . patient: right . therapist: so it doe thing like it put your heart rate up it make your breathing speed up you ready to run . it can sometimes make people feel a though their mouth is dry . it can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded . but those are the kind of symptom that you can get . patient: all of those actually okay . therapist: what often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release out of the blue perhaps at time of stress and you mentioned that there wa stuff going on at work and you feeling a bit stressed out and you in town it wa a bit hot . so that may have been what wa behind that very first panic attack . what happens to people is that once they had one panic attack they go on to have more . patient: hmm . therapist: and the reason for that is that once you had something like that happen to you you kind of there thinking oh will this happen again ? patient: is that something that you are absolutely sure . i have started to really monitor my heart and when it start to race i start to get worried . and then it start getting faster and faster so it doe feel that therapist: yeah you describing it exactly . julie that what we call hyper vigilance . so you they kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart . and for most of u our heart rate will go up and down all through the day but most of u do worry about it because we do notice it . patient: right . therapist: but because you had a panic attack you they thinking what my heart doing ? patient: yeah . therapist: and then the minute it start to change you clock it you notice it and then you start to get anxious thought you might worry and patient: i really start worrying thinking thinking is it going to be now ? you know is my heart gon na stop beating therapist: right so you get those kind of anxious and they very frightening because you thinking oh my goodness me could my heart on that make you even more anxious and that cause even more adrenalin to be released . patient: right therapist: and that make the symptom even more pronounced . and then that make you believe even more that there something wrong with you . doe that make sense to what might be happening ? patient: it doe make sense doctor therapist: one of the thing that you have been doing which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you started to to avoid doing thing that trigger it off . patient: yeah like not walking to town or anything like that anymore . therapist: exactly . and whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptom because you do have to get panicky what happening is that the more you avoid doing thing the le likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful really happens . patient: right yeah . therapist: doe that make sense ? patient: it doe . it just make sense therapist: well if we all started to tackle this a if it wa an anxiety problem there are a number of approach we can think about tablet . and we gon na think about other kind of talking approach . there are pro and con to those and side effect and thing that we need to discus . so i just slightly watchful of the time we seem to be coming to the end of today session for the appointment but all right well i wonder is whether we should meet again perhaps next week and look again more carefully at some of the treatment option and think together about which might suit you best . patient: okay therapist: how would that sound ? patient: you know that fine . that fine . therapist: any other question before we end this session patient: no i will make an appointment to see you next week therapist: i see you next week . patient: okay thank you doctor . therapist: pleasure . all right . patient: bye bye .",
            "patient heart start to race like boom boom and get chest pain . patient cant catch breath and get very afraid like gon na have to die . patient is avoiding sex in case that put heart rate up . it began six month ago pressure at work went to town patient had the first of these attack . patient had an ecg . therapist agrees with dr . jones and do not think there is anything wrong with heart because ecg is normal . patient doe not smoke blood pressure is fine fit and active . patient is worried about his dad having had a heart attack but he wa lot older than him . so the patient is not really in the same risk . therapist diagnosed this might be anxiety that is giving these symptom . therapist explained patient about anxiety and panic attack . patient started monitoring heart and when it start to race but patient get worried . therapist told it is hyper vigilance ."

            "therapist: hi smith how you doing today ? patient: good . how are you ? therapist: i doing all right . how thing been since last week ? patient: um thing you know i been really sort of preoccupied and anxious a lot this week . my daughter got sick . so i had to take three day off of work to take care of her and i starting to worry she been sick a lot since i gone back to work she in daycare . and i had to take a lot of time off work and i getting close to going over my allotted amount of day . and so i finding myself being very anxious about that and then feeling guilty because when i trying to take care of her i always worrying about work so therapist: okay sound like a couple thing may be going on . in child ha been sick so youre taken off day . so there a little worried about your relationship with your employer . at the same time you want to make sure you taking good care of your child having trouble reconciling those two . patient: yeah . therapist: all right . what wa the last time it happened can you described what happened ? patient: the last time i had to take off work ? therapist: hmm patient: it wa just this week . she woke up one morning with a really high fever . so i had to call out that day and then she still had a favourite the next day and then i had to take a third day because she ha to be fever free before she can go back to daycare . so the first day wa i wa okay with that . but then like the second and then when i started realizing that i wa going to have to take a third day and i really start to get kind of panicky and were worried about it . therapist: alright so let me see . let go through each day . right . so the first day when we discovered that she wa sick right well we thinking that when you had to call out of work patient: well because she been sort of sick a lot lately i wa a little bit worried . and i wa sort of you know i have this number because i only have day for the whole year . so i had this number in my head and i just thought okay well there one more day i got to take away from that that i have and but i wa able to sort of think about i wa a little worried about any work that i would miss you know keeping up with my caseload and stuff at work so but i wa able to kind of figure out that i would be okay for a day and i can kind of make up for that when i get get back . therapist: okay so you thinking wa this is ideal but i can i can live with it . patient: yes therapist: just one just one day ? patient: right therapist: how about one on one day two when you realize that you gon na have to take a second day patient: and i got a little bit more worried and then i did start to also you know add the worry of i wa going to start to get behind at work . not only wa i missing more time but i wa also going to be behind on my work . so then i started thinking when i go back it going to be a mad scramble and kind of catch up and keep up with everything . and you know so it wa going to became worrying about my workload and worrying about taking more time . therapist: okay . so a little more stressful version of what happened on day one . and then how about when you discovered that you had to take a third day off ? patient: i wa then it wa just more amplified you know amplified worry and it wa a lot harder for me to let it go . i just kept thinking i kept going back to it . and then i started feeling guilty . because i wa so preoccupied worried about that . and i wa trying to answer email and do some stuff and send out some email to people that i work with to try to help me out with thing at work since i wa there . and then i felt guilty because i wa really caring for my child a best a i felt i should have been you know i started feeling kinda like a bad mom . therapist: so guilty and a bad mom . and that wa mostly on third . that wa the worst of it . patient: yes . therapist: now this go up against the weekend wa the third day friday . all right so so then you kind of knew that by monday thing would be better . so tell me what happened when you returned to work on monday ? patient: well i checked in with the main office and you know i just said i really you know i starting to worry i getting i know i had to take a lot of time . but you know i done the best i can to try to make other arrangement but my you know just starting back in starting in daycare she just been sick a lot and i ca control it . i doing the best i can . you know i asked them if there wa anything i needed to do a far a providing doctor note and stuff . and they said no that they you know they do need a doctor note since it wa my daughter that wa sick . they said there nothing nothing that i really could do and just try to not have it happen much more if i can therapist: just do what i can to not miss more . so they said that ? patient: yeah but yeah . they kind of just said you know do what you can do not have it happen but if it you know if it ha to happen you know what can i do about it ? it wa kind of they were saying therapist: so they were understanding ? patient: i did feel like they were that understanding but i also did feel like they were gon na take any punitive action against me right right then and there or anything . therapist: did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced ? patient: yeah i did . and i also anticipated that they would maybe have more of a procedure for how to handle it and they did have a procedure which also made me feel a little worried . i ca imagine i the first mom that ha had to deal with this . and they kind of talked like it never happened before . so i kind of felt anxious because i thought am i really the first mom that had to take a lot of time off because their child sick . they did give me the impression that they had sort of a protocol or like they had dealt with this before . therapist: a a sort of like it took them by surprise ? patient: yeah or they just did have a plan for what to do about it . therapist: and they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that ? patient: no no i guess not . therapist: and when wa the second how long ? patient: just this past week this week . therapist: so how ha this week been back at work ? patient: oh it been very busy because i trying to catch up and get everything handled . but that the way it always always is . so nobody ha said anything to me or anything about the absence therapist: other than that first and other ? patient: yeah . therapist: and there been no more absence ? patient: nope therapist: okay earlier you mentioned being a good mom how a good mom look lik ? patient: umm somebody who take care of their child and put them make them a priority like their first priority . and you know doe the thing that they need to do to make sure their child is taken care of . therapist: and you a little worried through this wa last experience you talking about that you did rise level of good mom ? patient: yeah i felt like i wa being a good mom because i wa preoccupied and making work a bit of a bigger priority than taking care of my kid . therapist: okay so so good mom more about more than just rather your behavior right what you doing is about what you also thinking . so you took care of your child . patient: yeah . therapist: but your mind your thought are somewhere else some of the time . and that where you feel like you you wandered out of the good mom area . okay i been on the other side how about a good employee ? did you mention that ? you want to be a good employee ? patient: yeah . therapist: what what that look like ? patient: um well somebody that you know take care of all of their workload and handle all of the task that they have each day and someone that consistent and reliable and you know put effort into what they doing and get their job done . really you know reliably . therapist: and that where you feel like with the sort of the last workday you missed . you missed three . okay how about last year ? how many day have you missed ? patient: well i missed a lot for maternity leave . therapist: so that understandable but excluding that ? patient: i missed out since the school year started i missed if you include the three . i missed nine day . but some of those were half day . they add up to nine day . therapist: okay total nine ? patient: yeah . therapist: and you allowed ? patient: per school year it only january and i already at nine . therapist: i can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over the patient: i do know . i mean i think that they would dock my pay for the for those for it . if i wa there a day and i did have any more sick day left . they would just dock my pay for that day . but outside of that i do know what else would happen . therapist: is anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to hr department ? patient: yeah i guess i could contact the hr department . therapist: i just thinking because you just one day away from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them and see . see you know what to expect right ? so this whole thing though the missing day caused you anxiety frustration . patient: yeah a little bit therapist: about any type of feeling down at all ? patient: a little bit sometimes when i start feeling like i a bad mom . therapist: okay so that so a far a your child is concerned in your relationship with your child yes some anxiety relationship at work some anxiety but the sadness mostly surround how you feel you treating your job . of all the emotion of frustration anxiety what i refer to a depression i should say sadness . what bothering you the most ? what ? emotional response is probably the most ? patient: probably sort of the guilt and the feeling of not being able to be the best mom . therapist: how would you rate yourself right now a a mother if say wa the best mother you could imagine ? right ? and one wa the absolute worst ? patient: i probably like an eight . therapist: okay . that pretty good right ? patient: yeah . therapist: what would be the cutoff to where ? what the cutoff score ? and that will scale i just gave it for good mother and not good mother . patient: i guess like halfway like therapist: so five is good enough . patient: yeah feel like it not good enough for me . therapist: okay . okay patient: i would be okay with that . therapist: so if you look at somebody else another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable . right ? patient: probably . yeah . therapist: but how about for you specifically ? patient: yeah that not therapist: that not gon na cut it ? patient: yeah therapist: well we cut it . patient: i do know . at least a seven . therapist: and you an eight patient: yeah therapist: sure ? patient: no therapist: not sure . okay . so you close to the border . like you close to the border on you your value system of being not a good mother . patient: yes not a good a mother a i want to be therapist: okay . now what do you want to be ? patient: yeah i want to be like a eight or higher therapist: eight or higher where you are in s you said ? patient: yeah therapist: okay . so you want to be the parent sound like patient: well yeah doe everybody want to be the best at what they do ? therapist: i mean i think people are driven to to do their best . but is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a ? patient: no there some leeway i guess you have to allow for that . therapist: remember before in other session for the situation you brought in here we talked about dysfunctional thinking irrational thinking . how doe reflect on that like the usefulness of of these thought ? the you know the other mother can be a five and b . and that that good right ? you need to be an eight or hire a nine or doe it seem useful like a useful way of thinking ? patient: in some way it useful because it keep me keep me on track if that make sense . it keep me pushing to keep doing the best i can . therapist: okay so it doe have a useful side doe have an unusual side le than useful ? patient: well yeah i guess it doe in the sense that if i become too worried about it then i wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom . therapist: yeah . so i guess one thing i getting at here is ha to worry ha the anxiety or it paid off for you ? patient: probably not . therapist: why not ? so you suffering with it ? patient: yeah therapist: it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most it just causing suffering . patient: yeah . therapist: so at the heart of it you not a bad mom . right ? you in good mom category . you a good employee . right . but your your way of dying yourself your perception is that you not doing a great job at either one . patient: exactly . therapist: and that the thinking i getting that it not you know it not necessarily irrational . i thinking it just le than useful . it dysfunctional . patient: yeah i can see that . therapist: yeah we talking about that third day right . the the third day of work you had to you had to call off . and do you remember any specific thought that are going through your mind on that ? what wa that a morning when you figured it out ? like a friday morning ? patient: yeah . um no it wa really the night but um well you know i went a far a to think am i gon na get fired ? you know i had to kind of think about therapist: so your thought wa am i gon na get fired ? patient: yeah . therapist: and then what wa the feeling that that came right after that ? patient: panic and worry oh yeah therapist: maybe some anxiety ? patient: some anxiety ? yeah . therapist: were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time ? like did you tell yourself anything ? or did you take some action ? patient: oh i did tell myself that i did go over yet . and you know hopefully i wo you know there still a chance that i not going to go over on my day and hopefully wo go so far a to fire me you know therapist: and how did you feel after you consciously had that thought ? patient: a little bit better but the still kept hovering around . yeah therapist: the whole time . probably all the way till monday right when you returned to work ? patient: yeah . yeah . like i wanted to call somebody at work and talk to them about it and make sure it wa okay . but you know it wa the weekend so i could do any of those thing . i just had to wait it out . yeah . therapist: so we talked before about self talk you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response right ? so it the kind of pre packaged response we have two thought that we identified is not so useful . patient: right . therapist: so degree those thought like am i going to get fired and all that ? not very useful in that moment ? patient: yes . not useful in that moment therapist: understandable . right but not useful . patient: yeah therapist: so what you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that . like specifically i gon na lose my job . patient: well i guess i could say you know i did you know i not . i have had any conversation with anybody that have indicated that . so sort of like maybe i just need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when i come to it kind of thing . like hopefully it wo . i do know if it will happen or not . and hopefully it wo happen . therapist: so so there the self talk there is there no clear indication that gon na happen patient: right therapist: so why borrow the worry ? right ? how about other habit adaptive behavior ? we talked about the importance of support system before other session . is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that ? patient: yeah my mom can . can sometimes i did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take a day . but she could because of what she had going on but in in other time she might be able to take a day and stay home or my sister can do that a well . and my husband can sometimes it depends on what is going on that week for him at work . so there are some option there . therapist: did you explore those option for this last time ? patient: i did . i did but just the circumstance did work out . therapist: so none of those individual were available ? patient: right . therapist: is there any other option you have for care ? wa that it ? patient: that really it . you know when she sick and that really it because you do i do want to put her around any other kid which is why i would send her to daycare . so therapist: that seems reasonable . okay so there are some thing you already done . right . and i think at this point since to address i know this is the lesser of your worry which is your employer you more worried about being a good mom but to go look at the employer side first . second you can talk to hr you can try to understand what the consequence are for going over explained that doe appear to be your fault . patient: right . therapist: okay . and i do know what you can do in term of support maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedule when they available and or convey the nature of your problem to them . customer support patient: yeah . therapist: so that wa one issue . now if you highlight more prominently though the good mother want to touch on that a well . you did everything you had to do to care for your child ? patient: yes therapist: are you sure ? patient: yeah therapist: okay hundred percent ? patient: except for my my thinking i wa maybe a little not a present a i should have been . therapist: okay . and we get to that but your behavior behavior . yeah you did everything a good mom would do . patient: yeah . therapist: okay . so is it okay ? if you doing everything you need to do to think thought that do seem congruent with that you know the distract you away from that ? patient: i guess it not ideal but it okay . therapist: it not ideal . so you really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what going on your child to the exclusion of what going on other circumstance ? patient: you know or at least be able to put my worry about the other circumstance aside for the time for that time period . therapist: so by addressing the employer issue that might give you a little relief one good mom ish . all right . so here another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thought . i think that is reflect on whether you a good mom or not you really basing it on this idea that if i thinking about something other than my child i in the wrong place in term of being a good mom . are you only being distracted ? patient: right therapist: so that push you on a one to scale ? patient: yeah therapist: the more thought you have like that you think of it a like pushing you down toward five . patient: yeah . therapist: okay . so when you have those thought what an adaptive response or you know self talk what can you tell yourself in those moment ? patient: that i doing them behaving doing the behavior that i need to do and the baby doe know what i thinking so probably not . she doe know what i distracted or worried . so i not doing any harm to her . therapist: who doe know you distracted or worried ? patient: i guess just me . therapist: just you ? patient: yeah . therapist: so the self talk that would be i doing what i have to do to be a good mom . and that what my child say . right patient: right . therapist: but i have these understandable thought that come in where i worry about other thing and more or le justice what it is right ? i mean you permitted to worry about thing life is going to be worryfree patient: true . therapist: but we can we can work to not suffer more than we have to patient: right therapist: that kind of make sense ? patient: yeah . it make sense . and you know when you say it back to me the thing that i saying it doe sound a little bit irrational or unhelpful le than useful . therapist: yeah it a little le than useful it not you know i want this important distinction . it not good or bad right . and those word have a function right in our in our life but they a little dangerous when applied in term of mental health when they applied to thing like you know good mom bad mom . patient: right therapist: but doe leave a lot of gray area to talk about . improvement . right ? also it seems like what you describing your your way into the good mom category anyway . sure . or i think most people would be happy with an eight out of . patient: true therapist: so it not like you drifted down toward five before somewhere . okay . so there a couple different yeah i know we talked about two different subject right but they related the work situation and situation care for a child . but those are some self talk strategy . so i like you to do when you go home today and i would i would ask you to do it today if you can . okay i think it important in the state in term of time near when we having this conversation . if you could try to document some of those automatic thought . remember i gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response . patient: okay okay . therapist: maybe around this area or maybe about other area a well it doe . it okay . if you have other problem you want to apply the model to but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance . that the real struggle that going on right now inside of you . is that right ? patient: yes . yes . therapist: do you think you be able to have that completed ? next week ? patient: yeah i think i can handle that . yeah . therapist: okay . so we leave it there and i see you next week . patient: okay thank you . therapist: thanks .",

            "therapist: hi joe how are doing today ? patient: i doing okay therapist: just okay ? patient: well i know we talked before about me thinking about suicide and i starting to think about it you know like a little bit stronger than before i think a little bit more clearly . therapist: so can you can tell me a little bit more about that ? patient: um well one we talked before i had the feeling and the thought of suicide but now it kind of starting to like i thinking about it more often . i thinking about a little more clearly and that alarming to me . therapist: do you want to die ? patient: yeah i will . yeah sometimes therapist: sometimes ? patient: um i mean you know sometimes i know it would be scary to try it and my husband would be so hurt but at the same time i want to end this . i want to end the feeling that i having depression . yeah . therapist: okay . do you have any plan a to how you would end your life if you decide to do that ? patient: i mean i know if i wanted to that we have pill in the cabinet . so it would be that hard i could just take the bottle and therapist: just same pill that you prescribed for depression ? patient: yeah . therapist: do you feel like you going to carry out that plan ? patient: no i mean part of it . that why i nervous because like i worried that i might but at the same time you know i afraid to so sometimes i think that i might and sometimes i think i wo . i do want to but sometimes i get scared that i will . therapist: today you a little worried that you will or you a little closer to it then than usual . we talked about this before in the past you come in you had kind of that same plan to pill and the thought and what what stop you those time wa stuck in the past . patient: in the past i thought this will get better . i just have to keep trying i thought what will my husband feel when i gone and my family my parent my brother and sister i thought that this is a bad a it can get . it ha to get better eventually . but now i just starting to feel like i do think it gon na get better . therapist: alright so there time before when you had the same feeling right ? you felt just a bad a you feel now really down hopeless . what happened a few day after that after the thought suicide went away . what wa your outlook on life that ? patient: i mean i feel i feel a little better . you know and then i say to myself that wa silly you know i do want to do that . i do i do want to end thing . you know . it it too rash . but you know it starting to feel like a permanent problem . therapist: so if you feel like this time these suicidal thought are markedly different than what you experienced before . patient: i would say markedly but i would say they different . they a little they stronger therapist: more intense ? patient: yeah therapist: when you think about this these feeling on before we talked about i know this relationship surrounding relationship the same thing this time ? patient: i mean i guess that ha something to do with it i guess . it just like when i look to everything like everything that could be good or everything just everything like life my relationship the future i just look at it and i see despair . i just see everything going wrong . and i just do see how it could get better . i just do see it therapist: in a sense of hopelessness ? patient: yes . therapist: so this time is different because you feel it very le situational le tired of relationship and more well philosophical you looking at your outlook and you saying it not gon na get any better . what the point going on ? so this is a little bit new territory for you . how long we been feeling this way with the intensity right now ? patient: probably a week maybe a little le therapist: what wa prevented you from hurting yourself those last week ? patient: i afraid to do it . i just scared . it like it like jumping off a diving board . like you get up to the edge and you stand there that where that therapist: have you made any gesture to harm yourself ? like if you went and grabbed the pill or went to the medicine cabinet look at the pill anything like that . patient: sometimes i look at them look at them . therapist: do think further than look at them ? patient: well i mean so i have to take them . it my prescription . so when it time i start thinking about it . like it more i think about my like the ideation come even more because it like a trigger like i thinking about the pill . so i go to the cabinet and i get my pill and i and i take the the one that i supposed to but i just look at the bottle and i kind of stand there and i just think instead of putting the bottle back i could take it with me . therapist: and what do you end up doing ? patient: it take a while but i put it back . it it scary . like i look into the bottle and i afraid because dying is scary but therapist: and how about the pain that you would cause husband and the rest of your family ? patient: yeah i do want to do that . therapist: you do want that ? patient: i do . i do . i do want my husband to find me i do want him to feel like this is his fault . i do want him to be sad that i gone . i do want him to feel like i feel . therapist: and when relative of somebody that committed suicide hear about the suicide ? who do they blame ? patient: yeah . it not it not their fault . and i know that they would be able to get over it and i know that they be thinking about how bad i felt they have to know what it really felt like for me . therapist: so i know this is a tough time right ? but the good news is you here talking to me about it . right ? now you talking about it . i gon na guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better . are you gon na carry out your plan or you gon na hurt yourself ? patient: i do want to therapist: are you going to ? patient: no i think i think if i can just remember what it be like for them . that keep me from doing it . you know it the time that i forget to think about how they going to feel that i get closer to the edge . but when i remember you know like it upset me to think about what it be like for them . so if i can remember to think about that and it help me not do that . but i think having the pill there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for me . therapist: okay so can we can we do this ? your husband at home ? right . you mentioned you take two pill once a day ? patient: yeah . therapist: before for bed ? patient: okay . therapist: can we would you be willing to sign a release so i can talk to him . he can hold on to those pill . just give you the pill each night take one and i will that be okay ? patient: yeah i think i think that would be a good idea . therapist: is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house to give you a danger to ? patient: i think i think yeah i think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that wa in the medicine cabinet therapist: all the tool ? patient: yeah . therapist: would he be willing to do that ? patient: right . yeah i think yeah i think that he would be willing to do that . he doe . he want me to get through this . therapist: okay . if i get release for the talk you might sign it ? patient: yeah . oh i do that . therapist: okay . are you familiar before are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety or the prior time . so you been the state similar to this . can you promise me that you going to not hurting yourself . patient: i can yeah i can do that . at least until next week when we meet again i promise . therapist: let be a little certain that okay set up that for a more . patient: okay yeah we can definitely do that i can do that . therapist: i know this is a rough time trying to appreciate how rough it is for you . i want you to keep in mind how you felt after the time before . now you do tend to pull out of this . and you look back at a lot differently . but in the moment it hard to see that . that doe necessarily make this any easier . but if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression . you probably have a different outlook . if history is any evidence . doe that make sense ? patient: yeah therapist: all right . so what do you have planned for u today ? patient: um you know i just gon na go home . my husband will be home . work and have dinner watch tv . therapist: so are you gon na be alone anytime between when you leave here and when you come and see me anymore ? patient: um yeah i probably be home for a little while in the morning but i have to work so i wo have you know i be busy . therapist: okay if these feeling intensified or you do feel you gon na act on them which promised to call me and kill me call patient: yeah i do that . okay . therapist: i gon na get that release so you can talk to your husband . and then see it for a few minute or so point for more . all right . patient: thank you therapist: thanks joe .",

patient: yeah . for the past past maybe a couple week i guess few week . i have these morning meeting once a week at work and i have to make a presentation . and every time i go to present it my turn and i start getting . start getting really nervous . therapist: start getting really nervous . so your morning meeting at work . and so doe each person at the meeting present in like a row ? patient: yeah yeah we all take turn therapist: they take turn . and when you start to feel nervous when it your time to talk or before or after that and now patient: i usually the guy at the start of the meeting because i know i gon na have to there about of u and i always seem to be one of the last few to go like like six or seven kind of in line to present therapist: say around people at the meeting . yeah . and and a luck would have it you tend to be toward the end . so can you describe what happening say for the beginning of the meeting in term of what you experiencing ? patient: hmm . sowhen i walk in i usually okay and you know say good morning to everybody and then my my bos call mean order . and that usually when it start like kind of start like maybe like butterfly in my stomach kinda . and then after he make his report and then it just start going around the room and my heart start to be faster my palm get sweaty and i just i just start to feel really nervous . i realized that i might be kind of i start to tune out some of the other presentation . because i i start to become focused on how i feeling . therapist: and i focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you not really hearing what they saying . patient: yeah therapist: they saying patient: yeah therapist: all right . so go on . so so these you have these physical symptom this nervousness what happens and patient: yeah patient: by the time it it my turn to present i start . i just i almost like just almost shaking . yeah i noticed that my hand are a little little off . and so keep my hand down like in my lap and just that . i do want anybody to see them shaking like that . and i have a paper in front of me that i just kind of read from . but when i start reading my my voice is a little shaky and i kind of stutter and tripped over my word . and i just i feel like i not making good presentation and then it not looking good to my bos . therapist: so so in the moment when you when it your turn to present you still feeling that same nervousness like that doe that doe go away at all . and you trying to hold your body kind of still . like like almost a cube control . patient: yeah therapist: yeah . and then your voice this kind of sound like crackly or breaking up a you trying to read from like bullet point like wan na ? patient: yeah therapist: like an outline ? patient: yeah . therapist: what happens when you have read the last read last point ? patient: well when i done it it take a little bit for everything to calm down . but i i then i consumed by the idea that my bos think i did a terrible job and that he you know he regretting putting me in this position and that i ca make good record or you know that i did report the right stuff the right information to him and and so it doe really go away . it just it almost like my mind is shift someone i anxious about . therapist: alright so then the nervousness that stronger feeling of nervousness that go away is replaced by a more general feeling . nervousness about how your how your bos will think of you . yeah . because of the presentation quality . patient: yeah . therapist: because a you presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling he picking up on that . and you aware of that . patient: yeah . therapist: how how long have you noticed ? this these symptom that appear in this way . patient: um when you when i wa an undergrad in college i had to make some presentation from time to time and i would get nervous when i would make the presentation . and i just i mean most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe that what it wa . so you know just doing a presentation in front of like something people and so it did really did really bother me letter . i figured it wa just normal and always got you know decent grade . on my presentation so it never really bothered me . so i really feel like it only been an issue in the last few week . therapist: the last few week is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it a normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grade or anything right . therapist: do you have any other symptom that you think may be related or even unrelated to what going on ? patient: um i not sure if it if it ha any bearing . my my mom she she i know she doe like to speak in public . and i used to talk to her about how i feel nervous about making presentation . school and you know shoot oh you can buy it on . it tiny . and you know so i do know if that mean anything . therapist: so whatever you have going on you think that maybe maybe she ha that going on to patient: maybe therapist: the same same set of symptom at least . therapist: yeah . i mean i asked her you know i told her about this . and she ha been in a situation where she had to to do this kind of presentation like in a small group like this . and so i do i ca compare it to that . but i mean she ha said that she gotten nervous before . therapist: any feeling of sadness or anything like that ? patient: yeah like after i do after i make the presentation at work and then i do start feeling really sad . you know like i said because then i feel like my bos is satisfied with my performance and that he gon na regret his decision to give me this position . and so yeah it definitely make me sad . i feel disappointed in myself . therapist: do you have any substance use going on alcohol anything else ? patient: and now i have a drink every now and then it very very rare therapist: and in these i know this is something recent for you but in these meeting so far ha the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn ? patient: no no i i managed to control it i guess to where i can stay there . like i said i kind of zoned out some time when other people have been presenting and i feel bad about that too because i feel like they have important information to share with me and i should give them the same respect of paying attention but i become focused on on on what going on inside like my heart eating and the you know my hand and so i ca i zone out on them sometimes but but no i i pushed through it and i do my presentation . therapist: are you ever worried about what they thinking about ? she mentioned what your bos could be thinking about you ever worried about what the other worker at the table thinking about ? patient: yeah time cuz i feel like you know i the newest member of the management team and so i feel like they kinda like what is up with this chick ? i ca she get it together but you know there there been one person who been really supportive and you know she been like hey you did great today and great information and thing like that . so that kind of help me feel better . but i guess at the end of the day to me it really my bos opinion that matter because he my bos . therapist: have you ever felt you mentioned you nervous at the beginning of the meeting ? have you ever felt nervous ? well in advance of the meeting patient: i when i preparing like that morning to go to work and that one of those like okay i got this meeting at nine . and i start to think about i like on my way into work and but i do i do start feeling anything until i actually in the room . therapist: so have you noticed nervousness fairly intense ? pretty much only at these meeting . it been bothering you for a few week . something new something a little frightening for you . we get you set up with treatment . i get you in to see somebody in next few day . if that work for you . patient: yeah that be great . therapist: and i appreciate you spending this time with me . it been helpful . patient: thank you . therapist: thanks sasha .",

            "therapist: hey michelle how are you doing today ? patient: umm i am kind of doing i feeling a little bit stressed out therapist: stressed ? patient: yeah i feel like i have a lot on my plate . i have this test that i have to take for work . therapist: what kind of test ? patient: it like an aptitude test . it ha like math problem on it and like scenario in order for me to move up to the system manager position . therapist: now that a job that you been interested in for a while . patient: yes . yes . so i been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test . and i want and i just got really overwhelmed . and i started like i felt my heart wa racing . i felt like i wish my hand were shaking . and i just really could concentrate on the test . even though the night before me and my friend that practice problem and i knew all the answer with no proper like i did miss any of the question therapist: so you know the material on this test pretty well ? patient: yes . therapist: but the feeling and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating that feeling of anxiety plus those physiological response they got in the way of you completing it like you were unable to complete it . patient: no i wa able to complete it . and thankfully they gave me a chance to come back . i just told him i did feel well . so they rescheduled so now i feeling a lot of anxiety because i scared the same thing is gon na happe when i go back . therapist: so you were you were feeling great about taking the test in the first place ? patient: today the night before i felt like i know all the answer but the minute i walked into the room all of a sudden all these fear kind of took over . therapist: but did you know that wa coming ? patient: yes therapist: you did ? okay . patient: yes . therapist: so you had some anxiety in advance ? patient: yes therapist: or no you did . okay . patient: i had some anxiety the day before . but when i reviewed it with my friend i like oh i know the answer . i thought that would kind of push it down . but i think once i got there it all came back up to the surface therapist: erupt in that moment and that prevented you . what do you think is leading to this ? patient: well i always kind of struggled with test . i like i can remember when i wa in third grade i had to take this test because i wa really struggling in math . and i had to pas this test in order to move to the next grade . and i thought just like this test that i wa ready for it i had a tutor and i felt really prepared for it . and then when i took it i failed . and i wa held back . and i feel like you know that wa so it wa it wa really embarrassing for me to be held back . and i felt like i do want to say but i did feel like a failure at the time . because i felt like i really did know this . i do know why i could pas the test . therapist: and since that this wa third grade . patient: yeah . therapist: and since that bad testing experience . have you had trouble with test since ? patient: yes i always feel really anxious . i mean i able to pas test obviously because i graduated from college . school went on to high school . but it so hard for me because of this anxiety that i feel that even though i may think i know it i may still fail the test anyway maybe like a repeat of what happened . therapist: alright so in third and third grade you had a really bad testing experience . and a you move forward from there you never really been thrilled about taking test patient: no therapist: but you been able to adapt . you been able to take them and still like pas them . patient: yeah i mean sometimes i get an a . therapist: so that that good right ? patient: yeah . i mean yeah it is good . yeah it good . therapist: but this particular test which is not for scorch for work yeah this one this is more of a stumbling block for you . patient: yes . therapist: you have any idea a to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you ? patient: i think it just the fact that it this promotion . so it like the same thing . like if i fail i being held back . and i feel like it we live in that moment of being held back . and that that that like a fear that i have that um that by not being able to pas these test are holding me back . therapist: so it really that same feeling you had in third grade . that coming up with this test . patient: yeah i mean i did put them together until now . but yeah . therapist: and the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they did they did have that same value attached to them . patient: now because they did have all that pressure that it wa either win win or lose basically therapist: you could you could take them again or take the course again or ? patient: or i could take another test to raise the grade if i did do good on that . therapist: so you have you maybe had more option in school ? patient: yes . wa it fail you know pas or fail ? therapist: right so it the it the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this . and you do have the safety net that you had in school ? patient: yeah if i fail it then i not going to be able to get the promotion i would have to wait . just like i did not have to wait a certain amount of time . i think an ear before i could take it again . therapist: so this a lot of pressure . patient: yeah it is therapist: so is there any time limit to this test for work ? patient: um no there is . therapist: there no time . patient: no therapist: how many is it like a like a multiple choice ? patient: yes it is . therapist: okay . and you seem like like you said you said the night before with your friend . patient: yeah . therapist: you really well prepared for it . patient: yes . therapist: so i have a few a few thought about this . one is i wondering you know we talked before about cognitive therapy core belief . so i curious a to what you think about what core belief may be operating . for you now with this with this test this work test patient: that i could fail that if i fail i could end up being a failure at all you know the thing that i try therapist: something like i am a failure or i bound to be a failure i destined to be a failure . patient: i would say like i destined to be . therapist: okay so destined to be failure . so that so that potentially is a core belief . right ? that that operating . patient: i mean that what scare me . that that exactly the thought that i thinking when i about to take the test . and if i do pas that it just gon na have like this domino effect of failure . therapist: okay so it could be a core belief but it also seems like you still on that thought . like a you get ready to take that test . you thinking i just destined to be a failure . patient: yeah . therapist: and you having what sound like a panic response to heart racing . patient: yeah my hand shaking . therapist: are you in the room alone ? you taking the test ? patient: yes therapist: you are . so no one really seeing you have this . i would want to call it a panic attack yet we have really gotten too far into it . but it sound like it ha some panic like feature . patient: yeah . therapist: because it not . it interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the item . so okay . so one thought i have is you have you ever had panic attack in the past or anything like this ? the third grade thing ? patient: no not really . i mean sometimes i get worked out when i about to take a test okay but it only around test . therapist: and what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increase and you have any other physiological symptom would patient: want to actually do take the test ? therapist: hmmm patient: um i kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question . therapist: so one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response . right ? so which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk i wonder if your doctor response could be i can ride this out like you have no time to test ? patient: yeah that true . therapist: i mean the panic response only maintained for so long patient: and i could also choose like maybe question that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress therapist: to get some in a sense to get some minor victory under your belt by like answering those right you know you closer to achieving your goal patient: yes and then i feel like i know at least i know that like do validate the feeling that i maybe i can pas this test . therapist: so the more item you you answer correctly the le anxious you gon na feel because you closer to the end of . patient: yeah definitely . because then i start to feel more calm because i know that i know these question are definitely going to be right . therapist: so that so that one well that a cognitive and behavioral strategy right ? like you can you can wait out the panic . i mean you in the room alone . patient: yeah that true . nobody there . nobody gon na see me . i kind of trying to get myself together . therapist: yeah . now the panic painful . right the you know the panic symptom are painful . so what you could tell yourself is this is pleasant . but i can write out these symptom because they only last so long . patient: probabiy i could use like self talk . therapist: exactly . yeah because usually mean peg symptom can run you know five minute . minute minute . but you have no time limit ? patient: yeah therapist: yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the item a you mentioned you could get right . and kind of at the same time be telling yourself i can ride this out . patient: yeah i mean i done that in the past so i can apply it to this test . therapist: so if that worked for you that ? patient: yes that ha worked and i passed . therapist: so that that certainly that certainly one adaptive response to try writing . another one could be that although it would be great to fail you can retake the test in a year . right . you could try it . patient: yeah that true . therapist: i mean i know that not what you want but but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that not working . right . the i i destin that wa the word right like i destined to be a failure . we know that not working for you . patient: so even if i have to take the test again and in a year then i not going to be a failure because i still have the chance to take it again . it not like i never be able to take this test again . therapist: yeah you just have you just have another year of study right ? and of course you would have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome i know you do want . but it not the end of your career it not like something so drastic it important to you and i can appreciate that . but it not the end of your career . you not going to be unemployed . patient: no no definitely not . and just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade even though i had to stay back . i still managed to you know do well the next year and keep moving up . and it ha really in the long run prevented me from doing anything that i wanted to do . therapist: so that great . that another adaptive response which you survived this before . patient: yes i definitely have . therapist: so this one event i mean i had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you do want that this kind of fashion . while use your word your destiny by like this wa one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptom . and fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again . and and i met you know so you have i imagine you could you can write out these these symptom . and i think you have the other adaptive response which is i been successful this before . patient: yeah . i mean definitely i feel a lot better now because i just know that no matter what happens i been here before and i can get through it a opposed to like that feeling that i going to just fail together . therapist: oh it so good when you have to take the test ? patient: on next week . therapist: so let schedule one more appointment right before that . patient: okay right . therapist: and we we make sure that you have these adaptive response down and you ready to go . okay . and really will kind of focus on the positive outcome . right . okay which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptom you having and fighting through the useful thought . patient: okay . yeah i mean that sound good . that helped me prepare for the test . therapist: great . so michelle i see you . i see you then and work through it . i really appreciate you coming in today .",

patient: no not really . therapist: tell me about that . patient: i mean it i do see it a a problem . it it legal in a lot of state now . and i mean it not that bad for you . it doe really endanger me much . therapist: so you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana ? patient: yeah i mean i not hurting anybody else . therapist: but at the same time you want to go back to work . and if i remember right you the person that you could go work for . i guess you know them right . yeah it my uncle your uncle and you need to be cleaned for wa about two month . patient: yeah two to three month . therapist: so therapist: you have kind of opposing force here right ? you have your enjoyment of marijuana . and then you you know that something you like you do wan na give up . and you believe you have a right to do that . but then there that job . patient: yeah i mean my parent are pretty cool with it like they know . but i mean i at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out . but i do know . i mean i just it be nice to have that job . like it a really good job but at the same time like i do see why i have to sacrifice something that i like . therapist: so it doe seem fair to you . but she recognizes the reality of your situation . patient: yeah . therapist: so it really doe come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment . patient: yeah it pretty accurate . therapist: so you not happy about that choice . therapist: and kind of what we did with the postpone gratification wa just really just ask you to wait minute and you were able to do that . and more although it difficult patient: it difficult . therapist: it difficult for you . therapist: so therapist: i asked you to track the number of time you smoke marijuana . did you really track that over the last week ? therapist: yeah you remember how many time that wa ? patient: i think patient: think i patient: think it like . okay between and therapist: between and . and how many time did something kind of get in the way that something else come up in that minute span that distracted you or that you enjoyed patient: i like patient: almost closer to time i guess otherwise i probably would have kept going smoke more . i mean there were a couple time where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and so i wa able to put it off for a little bit . therapist: so you can see in that minute thing can happen . right thing can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana . sometimes nothing doe and after minute use it . and sometimes something doe kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you did use . therapist: so with that in mind therapist: you found the experience rough but wa it tolerable ? patient: yeah wa it bad therapist: wa a bit do you think for this next week ? we could try postpone gratification from minute to minute ? patient: i do know . that seems kinda . yeah that seems like a longer time therapist: that that is definitely . that is a longer time . patient: i do know about that . therapist: yeah . patient: maybe like minute therapist: no compromise . okay do you think you could maintain minute weighing ? patient: i think i could try a little bit more than . therapist: all right so let go with minute right . so minute you know a compared to . i give you five extra minute that something could happen that could distract you . and you would use that instance right . there also you know to constructively use that time you could consider alternative like like you mentioned walking right . you could use that time and start walking . yeah . anything else that that you like maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana but she did have anything available ? what would you do instead ? patient: binge watch tv therapist: or should it be okay well so perhaps in that minute time period that that timer you delaying using marijuana you could start watching the show . patient: yeah i can do that . therapist: at the under minute you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show . so do you see kind of how it work ? like is it making sense to you the postponing ? patient: yeah it doe make it any easier but it tough for you . yeah . yeah . no i definitely see how help therapist: and maybe if we successful to ? therapist: who know ? we move it up from there . patient: maybe we see how the go see therapist: how it go the ? yeah i see how that go . you know i hoping . and i hope this kind of make sense that there be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the time that use marijuana . like because you giving yourself that many more opportunity the longer you wait . right . the more minute you wait the more opportunity for something else to get in the way so to speak . and probably what you see just like you saw this last because you you know you used marijuana le frequently just by waiting the minute . even though you described a difficult i sure it wa but there were a few time where it kind of worked out patient: yeah . therapist: so i think that planning something for that time would be helpful . and try to plan something minute even if you fully intend to beyond the to go right and use i think it still useful plan something in there . you never know that might take you . or you might end up walking or watching tv or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use . okay . so that like a plan . patient: yeah i think i can give that a try . patient: okay therapist: sound like a plan ? patient: yeah i think we can manage that . therapist: all right . we go with that . and i see you next week . okay thank you .",
            "last week postponed gratification wa discussed with the patient . the patient ha successfully been able to maintain waiting minute to smoke marijuana at least in most case roughly . there ha been instance where patient even forgot marijuana . the patient feel the same towards marijuana since last session since it is legal in many state and doe not hurt anybody else . however the patient ha a nice job at uncle for which they need to be clean for two to three month . the patient doe not see why to sacrifice this for a job . the patient is requested if they can postpone gratification from to minute . the patient is suggested if they can watch a show to use up time . the therapist clarifies that the patient is giving many more opportunity to interfere by longer they wait . the therapist will see the patient next week ."

            "therapist: hi ann how are you doing today ? patient: hi dr . grande about the same . therapist: about the same ? patient: yeah therapist: what wa going on ? patient: well it might be a little worse had you know i been talking about my problem with the perk . the past couple of time i seen you and i do know i think at work they might be starting to notice a little bit . therapist: they might be starting to notice that you under the influence of the percocet ? patient: yeah . therapist: could before i remember when we talked it seemed like you felt safe in that no one wa gon na find you out . patient: well yeah because when i take them i feel normal . like it make me feel like i can function . and i feel normal . but like definitely last week my coworker in the cubicle across the way wa she wa looking at me she wa just looking at me really funny and and then also i been having a little bit of trouble with the number . i just not . i not on my game the way i used to be . and i know that there is a connection to the drug . therapist: so in term of concentrating focusing ? patient: yeah yeah definitely . it hard to focus but if i do do it i do know . i mean i can barely get out of bed . i can i do know i completely what to do therapist: and this is tough for you . the percocet make you feel normal . i would talk about this before . yeah it used to give you high but not anymore . patient: no right . it is not fun . therapist: but it make you feel normal . patient: right . therapist: and we talked about the detox option . patient: oh god no . no no no therapist: it not something that you want . so really what changed to make thing more difficult is that you worried that your coworkers are on to you . right . and it your performance in term of focusing on on your accounting work ha been compromised a well . patient: yeah therapist: is that right ? patient: yeah . and when you put it that way she definitely noticed it and she talk to so it not like she if she think something up . with me she going to keep it to herself . so that would be the reputation piece and then also the quality of my work . i know it it not the same it a lot harder for me to produce what i used to . therapist: and you afraid that going to be noticed a well ? patient: yeah for sure . but i ca take detox there it just not an option . therapist: alright . let talk about i want to do some scaling work . i want to talk about the importance of this change to you know cuz we been talking about this change for a while patient: that change like giving up the percocet . therapist: yeah . let talk about let just talk about the importance of it though . so just focus on that one narrow piece . okay we just we just talking about how important it is . so on a scale of one to with one being not important at all and being extremely important . how important is it to you that you that you can make this change ? can you make this change ? patient: see i go back and forth . i do know that it that important . well if i lose my job that would be horrible . so maybe it is pretty important . i mean it important that i keep my job . it really important that i keep my job and then it keep my reputation . therapist: well so it important that you keep your job and that importance in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using percocet . they been tied together a little bit right . patient: yeah because to get out of bed yeah . okay . therapist: so if you if you if you had to pick a number one to or is extremely important . how important is it to you to make the change ? patient: . therapist: so fairly important . patient: alright eight . i mean i got to keep it up . therapist: you have to keep it up ? patient: yeah . therapist: so let talk about another construct . that important . patient: okay . therapist: i want to talk about confidence . so using that same scale how confident are you that you can beat the percocet ? patient: that what i been trying to do for how long have i been coming in here ? therapist: about about six month now . patient: i tried i mean i have really tried . i know i ca i do i do . i do think i can do it . therapist: so it wa in the one to scale . what do you think you would be ? patient: like i ca . i been trying . therapist: so very low confidence nope really no confidence . you have no confidence . you have no confidence that you can change and it very important to you that you do change . so this is a real bind the trend . patient: yeah it pretty depressing . therapist: you mentioned that one of the reason your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six month and working with me and you not been successful at stopping the percocet use . patient: i leave here swearing to myself . i done . you know that next week i going to come in and i going to tell you that i did use at all and then like before i in bed . i already taken some you know that night . therapist: so it easy to see where the low confidence rating come in . based on your experience the last six month . how about other time when you been able to make a tough change ? if you look through your your past and different experience ha there been any other occasion where you have been successful beating something like this and making a tough change ? patient: well yeah i mean i used to i used to with the gambling i guess i i used to hit delaware park you know on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband wa pretty upset about it and i had a really hard time stopping that . therapist: so that wa those tough that wa . would you say that you felt addicted to gambling ? patient: we oh yeah definitely . therapist: and it wa painful to stop . are you happy that you did stop ? patient: oh god i would never want to go back to that . yeah . therapist: so when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling right how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then ? patient: yeah that that a really good point . i did think that i wa going to be able to say probably about a to two or three . therapist: so there some parallel here between what happened with the gambling and with what happening now the percocet . patient: i did think about it that way . so i really did think i could do it then and it been you know a couple year since i even been in a casino . therapist: so you would say you were successful at beating that addiction ? patient: yeah definitely . therapist: definitely success so what happened ? patient: it so different . it different . it so different . oh my god . let talk about that . just like i just find myself popping them in my mouth . you know . therapist: so the mechanism is different . like for the gambling you have to drive to the casino to drive delaware park . patient: right therapist: you have to have money patient: right right . therapist: whereas the the percocets so easy . yeah that you get them for my friend . patient: yeah . therapist: and it a lot easier to consume and percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different . patient: okay therapist: but wonder if there any similarity with this ? well with the success and the potential success meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling you think that you could never get through detox ? patient: i did think about detox but you right . it wa miserable in that period when i first stopped kind of casino and i felt that really strong urge to go . and i made it through that my husband wa amazing . therapist: you husband wa supportive ? patient: oh yeah he wa really great . he would sit with me he would talk me through it . we go to movie sweet you now he wa really encouraging . probably be really happy to see me stop using these percocet too . therapist: so a you reflect on your confidence and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now . it probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past . all the circumstance were different . patient: okay . therapist: but you gained too high from that gambling . patient: yeah . therapist: that wa it wa addictive ? patient: right therapist: and and you beat it and it and it wa hard it wa challenging but you also have a supportive husband . would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop percocet ? patient: oh yeah . yeah . he he really you know upset by the way and i taking them and he really worried about me losing the job . i do see why he would be able to help me in the same way i guess . therapist: well since this since stopping is important to you but your confidence is low . but this might be a good area to kind of process which is you know you do have the support in place and you have successfully defeated addiction before . so it something to consider a you weigh you know i know that detox is something you expressed really clearly that you not a big fan of and i can appreciate your reason . at the same time get support you do lose your job . so let do this . let between now and when i see you next maybe reflect on some of the strength and support and the past success you had . patient: okay therapist: and see if we can accurately factor those into this equation . right a you processing through and and considering a very tough decision . so it make sense ? patient: i can definitely do that . yeah . therapist: so we pick up next week there . and i really appreciate you coming in today . patient: thanks a lot . therapist: thanks you",

            "therapist: vanessa hi nice to see you again . patient: it good to see you . therapist: yeah . how are you ? patient: i doing okay . and you know thing have been settling down a bit i think . therapist: yeah the last time we saw thing were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharge from the house . for about a week ago patient: yeah yes therapist: your how your injury ? patient: it it pretty pain you know had a lot of pain in it . i been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on thing that are happening . i been busy with my church duty and with my kid therapist: you even trying to stay fit . patient: yeah yeah it been hard to think about myself when i have so many other thing that are more way more important than me to deal with . therapist: how are your kid doing ? patient: they doing okay you know the little one were pretty kind of stressed out when i first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what wa going to happen but the older the older kid have helped out quite a bit . so i think they pulling together . therapist: imagine that there some you know period of readjustment and healing and sadness or a in it sound like also just trying to get thing done . patient: yeah i mean my motto is just to keep moving you know moving a fast a i can trying to get you know keep the house clean and be good you know with my duty with my church and trying to keep the kid focused on their activity and not to be too focused on what happening in me and paul life because you know there nothing they can do about that . therapist: mm hmm . so here you taking care of a lot of people your community your kid all the while trying to take care of yourself . that a lot . patient: yeah . therapist: i really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on . well you know last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kid and yourself safe . and i wa wondering if you be interested in talking a little bit more about that today ? or perhaps if there something else that you would rather talk about patient: no i you know i made time today to talk about this . i think it really important to try to figure something out thing got very out of hand there . and so it it i looking forward to thinking about what what thing i can do . therapist: so so you were scared . it sound like you were scared . patient: it wa terrifying . i mean we police were called you know we ended up having to call the police . and paul wa arrested and spent some time in jail . i had child welfare folk crawling all over my house and my mom wa upset and neighbor were all being nosy and gossiping . and it it it wa just very scary . therapist: so so a lot of thing were turned upside down . and when you say it wa scary i hear you saying on some level wa scary for you and your your safety but it also sound like it wa scary because all these other variable or element were put in motion that were disruptive patient: right ? i mean it wa you know we had people come into the house calling and you know checking in are you okay ? or can you get a restraining order and my mom wa trying to get me to move in with her and you know it just too many you know too many cook in the kitchen . therapist: so a lot of people have some idea about what you should be doing . patient: yeah yeah so i just really i not i not gon na do that . i not gon na get a restraining order . i not gon na call the police . it no he know where i live . therapist: so say more about that say more about why you why you do want to call the police or you do want to get a restraining order . patient: they were they were throwing him on the ground . they were holding his arm behind his back and they have their gun and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man . you never know whether he going to make it to the jail safely . so i wa i wa terrified for him . and then the next day you know child welfare call in the house . therapist: it sound like that wa a very scary experience in moment for you . patient: yeah . because i a good mom . therapist: and given that experience you it sound like you part you maybe not a inclined to think about calling the police again . patient: yeah no no i told my mom that that you know that a last resort . and that i going to be meeting with some folk and thinking about other option . therapist: and that what you like to talk about today the alternative to calling the police . patient: absolutely . therapist: well what have you thought about so far ? what other idea do you have about what you might do ? in a serious moment where you scared patient: mm hmm . therapist: for your your well being and that of your kid ? patient: i think i most afraid . you know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control . and so i been thinking about what kind of thing i could do if thing are crazy and out of control . and i just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it wa came to my mind because he somebody who we talked to before . therapist: okay . patient: yeah therapist: so your minister someone that you thinking about talking to a little bit about what going on in your relationship ? what are your thought ? what would you what would you say to your minister what would you like to tell your minister ? patient: i really i really interested in telling him more of the truth of what happening in my relationship he doe know about he ha no idea that paul ha threatened to kill me . and then he starting to kill himself and the child . he know we had some marital problem some financial problem . he know that paul had some drinking problem . so there some of that but he doe know about him threatening to kill u or that he been hitting me or his rage . so i feel like you know that it time to tell them you know tell him some of that stuff . therapist: you feel like you been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reason why you would tell him these thing what might be some advantage or reason to do that ? patient: he been helpful before he really helped u a lot . we we had counseling with him over the last five year numerous time . and he ha been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have a relationship with and he been helpful in what way is he been helpful ? you know i think paul respect him a a man . and i think he care about paul . so he not you know my mom and my dad and my friend . they they they really bordering on hating paul . and they do . i do feel like they have any objectivity when it come to working with him that my pastor ha some objectivity . and i think he care about paul therapist: it sound like your pastor able to see him a a whole complicated human being in the same way that that you do perhaps that there this side of him that scary and that you do like and then there this other aspect of him that you you really do appreciate . and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that a well . what would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust and that paul might listen to what would be another patient: i do think that he going to likely go storming into you know our pastor house paul . that paul wo you know he gon na he he come back in at my mom door and he go you know storming over to my girlfriend house . but he not likely to do that . yeah i do think you will . therapist: so so . so your pastor home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go ? patient: right . . to cool off therapist: hmm patient: because thing got so out of control and crazy you know and and that not going to happen again . therapist: so you said that a few time now that thing got so out of control and crazy . tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that wa ? patient: you know you know my eldest son got involved . my arm wa wa wa harmed and thing were broken . he threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of u . and i had to call the police and i had to you have people coming into my house tromping through my house grabbing paul hurting him . you know he called me from jail and how can you do this ? you know what have you done ? you know i felt like what have i done ? how can i do this ? therapist: right . so so not only wa it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your child but afterwards it wa scary a well because of all the thing that patient: all that fallout . therapist: yeah . so so . so going to your pastor talking to your pastor possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantage . are there any disadvantage like what would be some possible disadvantage to talking to your pastor about what been going on in your relationship ? patient: that paul will know you know if he find out that i talked to our minister about this ? you know i have no doubt how angry he will be . therapist: so this could really be a trigger a significant trigger ? patient: yes he find out about it . therapist: so that a little bit of a difficult situation . yeah . a you think about this particular part of a safety plan on the one hand there potentially some real advantage and positive to speaking to your minister . and at the same time there this possible significant risk . when you think about you know the pro and the con in this situation what do you what do you make of that ? what do you where do you go with that ? patient: it it a risk i willing to take you know i have thought about this . and it wa you know thing got so out of control . and i feel like it time to do something different and to think about how we going to do this differently . therapist: you you really concerned . patient: yeah . therapist: and a part of you is really worried about the next time . and you appreciate that there are some risk involved in some of the safety planning . and you also feel like it a risk that you you willing to take given what is at stake . and really it sound like you feel like your life and your child life maybe at stake . patient: you know i think that thing ca continue the way that they are . i have to figure out something that going to work for me and for my kid and for paul . therapist: would it be right with you if i offered just a suggestion or a thought something to think about in term of kid and safety planning is something that i know other mom in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is sit down and have a conversation with their kid about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment when thing are if if thing get really crazy and out of hand i be curious to hear what your thought are about doing that with your kid . patient: i think my oldest my oldest son that would be a really helpful thing for him because he want to know what he can do . he want to do something he always jumping in . that how i got hurt in the first place because he wa jumping in . so helping him identify something that he can do that will keep u safe and to keep him safe would would be a great idea . therapist: yeah you so you see this perhaps a a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violence situation but having him turn away from a violent situation a opposed to turn into it without done . patient: yeah he becoming a man now too . he he need to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe . therapist: yeah . and a he becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you you also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe . and i heard you identify a few thing that you thinking about doing or would like to do . and thing that you feel like you actually do have control over . last time we talked to you you were very clear about the fact that you ca control paul when he in his fear and his rage and being violent . and what i heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control . you ca control him but there are some thing you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person your minister . patient: yes . therapist: and having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and and then the other piece may be having a conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in the moment . patient: yeah . therapist: and i confident vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and i here to support you in any any way that i can . and if it at all helpful i be happy to follow up with you in a few day and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more . patient: thank you i ppreciate that . therapist: thanks for your time . patient: thank you .",

            "therapist: hi how are you doing today ? patient: i good . but um there ha been visual you know we will work out like my motivation . sure . kind of it kind of related to that . um so i in school . and every few week we have like paper to write . and i know i know what i know i can do it . it just actually sitting down and doing it therapist: ok will tell me about the paper . patient: well they usually about five page long . and i just i just look at it and like it five page . but i like okay so i go sit down . you know on my computer . i like alright i starting reference . so i get i start off good . i do the reference . but then it like i get sidetracked . tracked so easily . and then i end up killing like two hour checking the news checking and then it go to my phone and then just looking at recipe and then it get really off topic and then i realized i have done anything . therapist: alright so you you have a five page paper you sit down to work on it . you have the reference you get that part taken care of that then sound like you kind of wander off a little bit . patient: oh big time . therapist: yeah . okay . and then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit ? patient: i get kind of annoyed with it . and then i like well you know i already you know it already time i try to do it tomorrow . and then you know either tomorrow doe happen or the same thing happens . and it just and then i end up rushing right at the edge of you know that due tomorrow and getting all these five page done . it really hard for me therapist: so you are you finishing assignment on time . so the promise of lateness patient: no i i get it done . therapist: you get done ? patient: it just all at the last minute . therapist: so it really the how the time break out is working out well for you . patient: yeah . therapist: you rather not be doing it at the last moment . patient: no i mean i try not to . i mean i set time aside to go sit down . i like alright you know we gon na start on this paper . then sidetracked . i watching tv . i on my phone . i on some other website . therapist: so these so these activity that you engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing also regarding the reference before you start writing . you said check an email . patient: yeah . therapist: and other kind of sound like unplanned small activity . patient: yeah . i mean there small thing that keep my attention but it not where my attention need to go . therapist: these are particularly engaging activity like something you need to do . no at that moment . patient: no i mean i look up you know right i started one reference and then who this article look cool who this article you know next thing i know i researching octopus or something . therapist: so like distracted patient: yeah distracted like at work . therapist: and then there a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you have really started writing . patient: yeah but it like two hour late therapist: is too late . yeah so you consuming time there . alright . so you have a few different level of activity . here you have the paper which it sound like you okay writing but you you maybe not highly motivated to write . patient: okay therapist: but you seem to be getting the reference done . okay . patient: yeah i mean i get some reference done . okay . therapist: you collect the material and then the writing part . that the difficult part . and then you have these behavior . in the middle which you enjoy doing a little but they not something that patient: i mean they not something i like am jumping for joy about it just something to to procrastinate . so i do have to do my paper . and i do think that i you know i not like oh i need to check my email so i do have to do my paper . it just oh i should check my email . oh i should check my phone . oh i have done this one oh i have seen this in a while . therapist: but these behavior still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper . patient: yeah that true . therapist: you may not be fully aware of that in a moment . but then you kind of become aware of that later that that the purpose that those behavior accomplished wa that they kept you distracted from writing . alright . so the the writing of paper and activity that a behavior that something you not really looking forward to . what the behavior that wa an activity that you really do look forward to you know think about and some level of engagement is there . patient: well there is this new tv show out that they just started a new season . and i have it all recorded like episode . but i ca find time to watch it . but i really you know i seen the first season i so interested in it . and i ca wait to see the next one . i guess that that would that i guess what make me really happy right now . therapist: so so you excited about this television show and you how you have the episode already recorded . and maybe one of the reason you ca find the time is because the time you using between the two part of writing this paper . patient: yeah . i mean this paper is taking me a lot longer than it should . therapist: right . so let let try this . when you when you do write to paper you really writing it . the writing part not the preparing part but the writing part kind of all at the end . right getting it done this the night before it due . all right . so i want to try a couple different behavioral strategy here . okay . and these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation . one is i think that it might be helpful and i want you let me know if i right here to break if it a five page paper to break it up into more than one night . because right now functionally at least a lot of what you doing on the last night okay . would be a more comfortable pace like like for example how long doe it take you to write one page ? patient: out an hour hour and a half ? therapist: so around an hour to an hour and a half ? you can complete one page . edited proof read ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . so it would take about five day . to complete the whole paper if you did an hour and a half each day an hour to one i have checked . okay . but how much time do you have from when the paper assigned to when it due ? patient: they give u about a week and a half to do therapist: i guess around day . yeah . patient: um i guess around six like because then i already done eating home from work . and i kind of de stressed already . six look like a therapist: pretty good time . so if you could work without distraction you would be done by around at the latest with this one page . patient: yeah what the one page okay so therapist: no distraction . just one page . yeah . all right . so let talk about the the episode the tv episode that you want to watch . okay ? how long are they patient: they an hour to an hour okay ? therapist: and once a time that you could watch those you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching like no distraction i guess patient: i guess around eight because that when i you know started getting ready for bed and starting to like really relax . and you know my husband home by that time and we can watch it together . he love the show too . therapist: okay . so eight so really good time for you to maximize patient: married . and that a great therapist: you know that a great motivator for you . and i want to try to use it a a motivator . kind of like a reward . okay so i like you to try to do is when you start like when you get all these paper assigned when the five five page paper pick the five night that you want to work on it . okay it could be monday through friday or whatever work for you . patient: okay . therapist: all right clearly within the day window though all right so five day within the day window do you have to turn in and then set that time at six is when you going to start because that a good time for you to work . patient: so let keep thinking about that when i feel like i getting off track . therapist: yeah that sure . patient: yeah . and not have to stress right at the end . therapist: yeah . and not waste that time in the middle . yeah . right . that that really eating more time and your show take patient: i see where you gon na . absolutely . therapist: doe this make sense to you understand kind of patient: yeah you know that helped me power through and not do thing unrelated by you think well if i get this paper done this page doe need to watch my show later . therapist: and i think that a that a helpful way to think about it . and that that the cognitive part of this . so this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we talked about these in the past right ? this is behavioral strategy the cognitive piece when you find yourself wandering i think you have to detect that . and you i think you have some level awareness that happening . yeah you have to detect that and say i want to watch my show and we looking forward to it . patient: okay . therapist: and that your motivation to move through the paper . and then you know when eight come okay . patient: all right that sound like a plan . all right . therapist: very good . so let try that for . i see again in roughly two week . patient: yep . all right . thank you . so a few week . therapist: all right . thank you . thanks .",
            "the patient wish to work out motivation to write paper . the paper is five page long and they start with reference . once they complete the reference they get sidetracked easily . the patient end up killing two hour of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute . the therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write . the therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five day and pick the evening at six o clock in the day window when they wish to do . the patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite tv show in the night which will be a great motivator . the therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two week ."

            "therapist: hi jessica how are you doing ? patient: all right . how about you ? therapist: i am doing okay . so um how have you been doing today ? how your week been ? patient: it been okay . therapist: um so in our last session together we talked about your lack of confidence . do you feel like you might be progress on that ? patient: i mean i been journaling like you said therapist: good good . patient: that been kind of helping . i feel like they still i mean it ha improved slightly . therapist: so when you say you been journaling were you able to when you had a negative thought or you know sometimes situation negative thought were you writing down a negative thought ? patient: yeah . not an addict . well mistakenly he told me okay therapist: and you were able to make it a positive thought . patient: yeah i mean i tried to do that . it helped some but is any improvement better but i think maybe just to keep doing it . but i wa more aware of how they realized how therapist: so do you remember kind of what what we discussed last time about how cbt work ? patient: umm a little bit not exactly but i just remember how my thought are causing thing . therapist: so would you comment review before we actually get into the session ? patient: yeah yeah . therapist: okay . so how it go is like a cya situation or an event happens . you have a thought okay . and what kind of last time it wa your lack of confidence ? and it could be like i not good enough . but that wa your your thought process last time correct ? patient: yeah . therapist: and then so when you have a thought you have an emotion . last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself you felt incompetent . and then your behavior issue where you lash out at others and remain . so do you feel like that you kind of understand that ? patient: yeah yeah . therapist: so i know last time i said we talked about your lack of confidence . so for example i know you mentioned that you also were having problem with using marijuana and depression . you had problem with depression . and you also had anger issue . and out of those which one do you think you ought to put up to discus today ? patient: probably angry . i feel like that the biggest problem . therapist: okay . coming over about driver issue . patient: i mean it not like i just like an angry person that just like snap in any light but i getdefensive i guess . i very defensive . and she lashed out but i never i lashed out my child summary . it usually always my husband therapist: can you telll me about the last time you lost your anger ? patient: we were unloading grocery and i actually had just had my hair done and cut in color . and i wa so excited . i thought he wa gon na love it you know ? and he looked at it and he of course paid how much money did it cost ? therapist: yeah thing are kind of expensive . patient: so total you know would have been and he told me that you know we been struggling with money . lately a little bit and then i did need to spend that much money and that selfish and therapist: okay so now what i writing down here is kind of like what we talked about how there no family situation you know thought and you have an emotion . so i know like what you were just saying the event or the situation wa that you got your hair done and that he wa angry about that . patient: yeah . okay . he wa yeah he wa just saying mean thing therapist: okay okay . now what did you in that moment when he wa being mean what wa now how youfelt but what wa your actual thought when he wa saying all that stuff ? patient: i selfish . you bought them selfish okay ? yeah . initially yeah that wa that wa it is right . that wa selfish when you actually thought selfish guilty guilty and sad angry angry very angry that he made me feel about what i wa doing that way i going forward he said that and then once he said that you know he put that thought in my head and it made me angry . therapist: okay so when he when when he wa getting mad at you and then telling you you selfish and you felt substrate got yourself i selfish and then you got angry . what did you do after you get angry ? patient: yeah smack . therapist: okay okay . patient: yep therapist: there wa physical contact there . patient: yeah i hit him upside his head . okay . i mean i felt that afterwards did need to . it just also mad that right ? yeah . hey you feel that way ? uh huh . i just lashed out . okay . therapist: so when he when he ha these he kind of get upset at you for certain thing like this . how do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response ? patient: i think if i wa able to get the same thing therapist: how do you think you might be able to do that ? patient: umm therapist: like this is how we would do it with cbt we would change your thought . so what he get upset with you and call you selfish . you start to feel selfish . patient: yeah therapist: so how could you not feel selfish ? even if you changed your thought ? patient: yeah i mean if i never even thought that i wa selfish then i would have been angry . therapist: so do you think you selfish ? patient: maybe the time i did die and i felt like awful but now like he say the wording for money but we really not one might want to pay our bill or i want to do thing i mean he just kind of like a cheap person . we have plenty of money to we not hurting at all and i do not feel confidence i do think it wa selfish to make myself feel prettier you know ? but i think people do have their selfish tendency . therapist: so i hearing you say is you do think you selfish at all . patient: oh i mean i selfish actuation you do know if you being selfish ? i really i really do know if i had gone and bought a whole new wardrobe with it but man i just did my hair . and he had pizza real estate agent . they had sold a big house that week so we had enough money for me to afford it . okay therapist: so instead of thinking i selfish what could you actually think ? patient: i deserve this and then how me sometimes therapist: i deserve this ? patient: yeah . therapist: i mean who doe deserve something every now and then . right ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay so if you were thinking i deserved that . that wa your thought when he wa getting angry . he thought no i sorry . this how do you think that would actually make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point ? i drive you so confident ? patient: yeah confident in my decision . i would still feel real sad that paint off but i do think it would be to the level that it wa thought wa selfish . therapist: so if you felt competent about your decision because you actually changed your thought do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there no need for this ? patient: yeah i think it would help me realize that that his issue and not mine therapist: right . so how do you think you actually behave them ? patient: walk off okay or he will be able to this is kind of what i wanting to get to a well be able to suppress it and no man he did deserve for me to hit him . he did . he said something that upset me but no one deserves that . therapist: right . so maybe i so thinking also that you selfish when he getting my back . could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me he just doe understand and maybe i need to tell him that i do deserve this . and explain it to him that this make me feel good about myself . patient: yeah yeah i could try that . therapist: because you know you know you not selfish . it just something that make you feel good . patient: and i think also he understood why i did it . because i mean he know that i have some subconscious issue but i do think he realizes how bad it wa or why i got my hair cut encasing it a she said the most girly thing you never asked me feel better about myself you know not be a well . okay . which go back to this precedent . so right . okay . therapist: so do you think in like in the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughtsin targeted change how you feel ? patient: i could try yeah therapist: yeah okay . okay . okay since we talked about your angry sheet i know you were saying last time that you were also having problem with depression and you also having marijuana use and either one of those would you want to discus ?

            "therapist: hi miss clark my name is alan lime . i a social worker at the family health center . dr . steele asked me if i would spend some time with you today . i really glad that you here . i just curious a to why he would send you to me . patient: well i came to see dr . seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that kind of getting the best of me . and in the course of my appointment with him he wa asking how i wa dealing with that stress . and i mentioned that my one or two glass of wine a few night a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some night and he had some concern about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something . therapist: yeah . so he he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress . and he concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing anything you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that patient: i suppose . therapist: okay . so you filled in one of the pink sheet and i take a look at that . patient: he told me to fill that out and bring it with me . therapist: okay thank you . so you say here that you have four or more drink in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit a well . and that you have one or two drink in one setting patient: typically yeah . therapist: and maybe monthly you have more than that . what what what kind of drink do you have ? what do you do when you typically drink patient: wine with my meal ? you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four . my stress is increased . therapist: so it time to increase your strength a little more . well based on what you put here you get it give you six point on this scale scale ranging from zero to point will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone . so if it okay with you to talk a little bit about that patient: okay therapist: okay . so that wa sunset run zero to . it not a sort of super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailment related to alcohol a well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or even stay there . this is a typical standard drink size over here i not sure whether that fit your description of a glass of wine or not patient: i feel the glass up so maybe a little more than that therapist: maybe the little space it upset perhaps a drink drink and a half each one . so that also increased a little bit more . so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here . and for woman healthy woman your age no more than three drink in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you perhaps already drinking more than that . so what do you make of all that ? patient: that news to me you know i thought red wine with your meal is supposed to be healthy . you know no more than seven in a week ? that seems kind of prohibitive ? therapist: yeah it seems seems a little le than perhaps you been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking . and certainly there there conflicting information out there about what healthy and what not healthy . imagine the increased stress work because we concerned doctor seal a your stress increase and if you were to describe you anything maybe some interaction between the two that would also be a concern for him . i would i would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol ? patient: well you know it doe at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress . and i you know like a good glass of wine . i do do drink the cheap stuff . i like the expensive . therapist: see like the taste of it . and it doe help to lower the stress even if it just for the fun of me drinking . what not so good thing about alcohol for you . patient: um well you know the night that maybe i have a couple more glass than i should i wake up feeling kinda yaak and of course part of my stress is finance . and i mentioned i like the good stuff . and so if i drinking more than i increasing my financial burden therapist: your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you drinking . patient: yeah kind of defeating the purpose they therapist: the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time . so on the one hand it low is it on the other hand it increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect . what do you make of that given that on one hand it lower on the other hand it increase and and now it increasing even more ? patient: and maybe i need to find some other way to deal with my stress . yeah . therapist: imagine investment thought so that what have you thought of trying ? patient: well i exercised in the past and that help . right now . my schedule is kind of out of whack and i just really do know what to do . that why i came to see dr . seal . i thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help . you know when i feeling overwhelmed therapist: and he may be able to i not saying that he can not just imagine that he concerned that if you continue to drink the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with it to mention that he concerned . i not completely sure . so you had some success in the past of changing behavior . and if you were to decide to make any change here that sound like you could draw upon that to make those change . how important would it be for you on a scale of zero to ? i have a low visual hero that if zero is not important ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine . patient: well i mean if if it mean that it increasing my stress and or he not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it fairly important maybe about seven . therapist: it it pretty up there . what do you choose a seven out of five or four ? patient: well again i got to get thing under control . you know my kid are dependent on me and i got to go to work to help ease this financial stress . and so you know all those responsibility therapist: there a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this . what if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale ? patient: well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction i certainly ca afford to you know have any more stress . so yeah therapist: so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it . and if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do . patient: hmmm therapist: how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking ? patient: i pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or an eight therapist: okay so it pretty high up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit ? i just curious about that patient: i you know i like a lot a glass of wine i do want to quit altogether i be willing to try cutting that . but now if it going to if dr . seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that i had to not drink at all i be willing to do that at least for a period of time . therapist: so you be willing to stop altogether . that what wa indicated by the physician . okay . so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it to cut back whether it to quit ? patient: well again you know if if i can get something to help me manage if maybe i can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know i be pretty ready . again maybe about an on that scale maybe an eight . therapist: okay so that that pretty hot there a well . it sound a though you pretty motivated to do something about this right now given any responsibility given your child learning at this point . and just on lowering anxiety in general it sound and that one of your goal a well . well i pretty confident once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you be able to follow through with it . based on your experience in the past of making behavior change . i mentioned some thing that you can draw upon . what one thing that you could do ? imagine you thought of some thing might help to lower your stress . patient: oh i you know that the exercise but again that that kind of difficult to fit in right now . i hoping that dr . seal will prescribe something for me to take when i feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some thing off of therapist: one of the thing we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialist may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody patient: that would be nice therapist: that also ha some information here if you interested some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what help limit on how it may be affected by medication that you take a well . and i wish you lot of luck . it sound a though you really committed to making this shift in this change . and i imagine doctor still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few week . patient: okay therapist: again i look forward to speaking to you in the future . patient: all right thank you very much .",

two month ? patient: i mean yes . i always been aware that the government you know is probably up just to thing that they probably should be and that they have access and ability beyond you know the normal person . but after i saw the kidnapping i had proof and so it it gotten worse because i feel like they know that i know . therapist: so you felt this way for a while but seeing what you saw two month ago that made you more short ? patient: yes . because now i have proof therapist: because i have proof have you ever been treated for depression in the past ? patient: yes . my dad ha taken me before when he wa worried about me . but i you know it never really been depression . it always been something else . like i fine . i just i aware of what going on around me . and i do think my dad understands that i do think the place he take me understands that . so patient: what have the people at the place where he ha taken you know what have they said about your condition ? patient: um you know they they try to say the same thing that you know i depressed or whatever but you know i know i know the truth and sometimes i just have to play along . therapist: just play along with it . patient: yeah because you know this is what the government want they want me to look crazy . so there nothing i can do about it . therapist: you think they want to discredit you ? patient: because if i if you know it kind of like smearing my good name . they see me in and out of different agency and appearing crazy . you know obviously a lot of people do believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off . and they write what they write on my file but it not true . i just know what going on . therapist: because you know what going on . that what led to all these occurrence . this is this ha led to the symptom . patient: yeah like lately yeah . like you know i have been asleep you know and you know i feel guilty about what going on . right . mean that i know and that you know i feel it hard for me to help them like with you know camera everywhere and i came to the grocery store without being watched . and i know they watching me so you know i i do everything else wa too you know like i go to work i do the chore because i have to make sure they see me going to work chore . therapist: so you see you kind of play along . patient: yeah . therapist: all right . so do you ever have any thought related to death or dying or anything like that ? patient: no . patient: no like i worried . no . therapist: you worried about what ? patient: i mean . i worried about the government you know destroying my life you know but i do want to die and i do think they going to kill me . i think that be too easy . and it would just be more proof . therapist: so there be more proof that the way you seen this real patient: correct because obviously i trying to tell people about it . and if i suddenly show up missing like there people are going to know . so i know that they not going to hurt me but they could make me look crazy and i worried about my life . like them worried in my life . therapist: about that way . hmm . how about any drug or alcohol ? abuse ? right ? patient: no nothing . i dont like to use those thing . all right . therapist: any medical condition ? patient: no therapist: ha there ever been a time when you felt like really very happy like how lotta energy it wa very happy for several day . patient: not really . therapist: that never happened ? patient: no . therapist: okay . therapist: have you ever heard or seen thing other people ca hear or see . patient: i think that i aware of thing that people but no like therapist: who been hospitalized before ? patient: yes . patient: but again it wa i tried to initially tell my my dad about some thing that i never knew about and he had taken me to the hospital but that wa before . therapist: so i would like to get him to talk to a counselor today . therapist: how do you feel about that ? patient: so really necessary today like can i come back another day ? therapist: i think it would be helpful for you . we had a counselor talk to you today . patient: well patient: i understand that what you need to do . so i guess that what the you know that what we need to do to get this over with . that fine . therapist: you can . you can be okay with that . patient: i can play along therapist: you can play along . therapist: sure . i want to thank you for answering these question . i know this is a tough experience for you have a tough time with everything that going on that you described . so it it been helpful for you to answer these question for me . and i just need a couple minute and i get you over to see a counselor and we kind of go from there . patient: okay therapist: thanks sherry .",

            "therapist: well that the housekeeping finish with kathleen . so perhaps you like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today ? patient: well actually wendy i having a lot of trouble coping with with my job . the hour are working are supposed to be to . and lately i just got so much work given to me . i having difficulty getting through the whole day with it . and i got a couple of teenage boy that i pick up after school every day because he so naughty . they not allowed to go on the bus . and so i made my hour to . so i give them a chance to get out of school and then at on on supposed to be there to pick them up . but lately it been later and later on getting there sometimes the other day wa five and the boy were just the naughty boy you notice and and they everywhere . they all over the school they getting into trouble and and then i late home preparing dinner for my husband and then he get annoyed and on it go it getting too much . therapist: so you supposed to finish at why do you think you not finishing it through ? patient: too much work ? and here what happening . we we do one dog work in a doctor surgery . i do know if i mentioned that . one doctor employed me but there are four within the practice . and i doing work for all of them when really i should only be doing work for one therapist: right so that really the problem that we get you work and there no way you can fit into the the time that you were employed to work . patient: no . and i just ca say no to them but they put the they put the work in my in tray . and then and then it not get into my head try and write those fallen . it there the next day in . and it it just all too much for u . therapist: i can see that i can see you getting quite stressed about it . so have you had any thought about anything you might be able to do about this ? kathleen ? is there anything you think you could do ? patient: well apart from just i do i do believe it such a good job but i probably have to i have to i have to tell some . i have to tell her . i think i gon na have to tell her therapist: so you really do feel that you need to talk to the bos that includes you and explain what the problem is . is this something you feel comfortable about doing ? patient: no no no no . oh she easy and and she is lovely and i just thought i do i do want to annoy her . therapist: okay because she wa lovely there . she say do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her that she actually be quite receptive to listening to you ? patient: well of course she would she therapist: okay . what i going to suggest kathleen is that we do something called a role play . and what that is is that we act out the situation whatever it is . and in your case it going to be you going and talking to your bos and trying to explain to her that you got a problem trying to fit your work into the house which is supposed to be working . so you be playing you end up playing your bos . now obviously you not going to get exactly the same response from your bos that you get from me today . but it doe give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it to practice it and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario . and what this could do happily give you a bit more confidence about the swing . patient: what do you put in a ? therapist: well we practice it right now . oh i can what we do is you be you . and i be the doctor that you going to see . let just think about a couple of thing to get it started . patient: so i pretend that i going to be coming into her tutorial . okay therapist: well what do you think would be the best time of day to do it ? oh topic day patient: time of day . i so busy so busy during the day i probably early morning might be the best first first thing in the morning . therapist: sound like a good idea because then you do have to worry . patient: that true . therapist: okay so have you had any got any thought about what you might say ? how are you going to introduce ? patient: i suppose i could say to her is this a good time to talk ? therapist: that fantastic . patient: okay therapist: because that give her the chance the opportunity to say well no it is . could you come in five minute . i sorry . oh go straight into it . that really good . okay . should we give it a try ? patient: okay . all right . therapist: so i gon na get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the door that what you do . yes yes . all right . so i want you to get out and just do that and then come back in a if you having to see your bos and the bos to tell me what to patient: do the role play out . therapist: yeah patient: okay . now good time to talk . therapist: yeah sure . good thank you . patient: well the problem is marianne on on having i having problem coping with my workload at the moment mainly because it putting me here too late in the afternoon . remember when you first put me on mile were to a well . no i finishing later and later sometimes i got too much work and a lot to finish on time because i have to pick them up from school and you know what they like . so i just wondering if if we can work well therapist: obviously you employed to kathlleine hour we want you to work so we do want you working back so first of all this is important that you know that we want you to leave at and that what i want you to do . but from what you saying the work you being given doe fit into those hour patient: i do know therapist: what happening here i getting too much work from the other doctor patient: all right i do know i do think you not but i did think that i be getting work of four because this doctor here and is only doing your work . therapist: i think i got the picture . patient: i do i do like saying no to them though . therapist: i glad you came to me . i really need this job . look . i really glad you came to see but obviously to is not enough . it a long day early a you supposed to work . so i need to have a look into this and see what going on . patient: it only half my day . the other half start when i pick my boy up . and they say naughty they are they are really well certainly therapist: kathleen . yes i have a look at it . but i want you to make sure that you do leave at every day . patient: well i think because i done that little rolle play feel a little bit better probably gone and seen the doctor will help therapist: obviously the response that i gave are not going to be the one you get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she . so there be something similar but the important thing is i think to work out that first opening gambit is it and it true and to do that and then flow on so that something i want you to think about . perhaps a few . you guy come and see me next week and about a week perhaps . patient: i have to sit home . therapist: well let look at it . what i like you to do is think about what we done today . yes but but do do . do overdo it do sort of keep it down for your mind . well exactly . that what i wa going to say . i can see that you getting a bit too . patient: i do like confrontation . i do like telling people what to do . therapist: i know . yeah . so having the right word is a help . that will help you to get a bit of confidence there . but importantly i think we need to relax a bit do we ? and there are some very simple relaxation exercise that i can teach you that i like you to go away and practice . so that horrified by next week when you come you practice those relaxation exercise because they have thing that you can use anyway in any situation . i tell you what i know you do have to lie on the floor . not for these because that not very practical before you go see your bos . so what i suggest is we look at you coming back in a week time and your practice the relaxation exercise we go through them again and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real . what do you think ? patient: okay that that sound good . i feel a little bit more relaxed just thinking about that actually .",
            "one doctor employed patient but there are four within the practice . i just ca say no to them but they put the they put the work in my in tray . it just all too much for patient . therapist suggest patient to relax a bit . and tell some relaxation exercise ."

            "therapist: hi kyle how are doing today ? patient: umm not not too good . therapist: not so good ? patient: no i just got into a fight my parent therapist: what been going on ? patient: well i i been doing heroin for for a few month now . and i did think my parent knew but i guess they they found a needle in my room . and i mean they knew what i wa doing . and they they told me that i have to start shaping up and i need to i need to stop doing any kind of drug because they said they said the next time that they find find any kind of drug and it it it they gon na kick me out of the house . therapist: alright so they at the point where anything else happens they discover it and you on the street . patient: right therapist: what are your feeling about being on the street ? patient: who want to be out there ever ? i do know who would be . i mean it would be hard just to kind of stop cold turkey and i know a couple buddy that did that and it it not good when you get junk sick . and i mean i kind of stuck because i do know . i do want to be out in the street but it just gon na be so hard . so hard to give therapist: so there are conflicting feeling here . you do want to be out in the street . but you do want to give up the heroin same time . patient: right right . i just i mean i do want to give it up . but i mean i kind of know i have to . i mean i a young guy i i could make it outside of my parent house and i definitely do want to be on the street . therapist: so you want to stop to avoid the consequence could happen . patient: right . but to this point have been able to . therapist: so this is the first consequence or potential consequence motivated you right since you started using patient: yeah therapist: how strong is the craving to use ? patient: i mean when i first started it wa i mean it wa pretty freakin great . i mean the rush that you get from it it it just mind blowing it it just amazing . but of i noticed recently that like the rush is a intense anymore and it even like it even kind of started to backfire a little bit where like actually i feel all sick without using it . and i mean that kind of scare me but the craving are definitely still there . therapist: right so when you when you try to cut back have you tried to cut back ? patient: i had before but a minute like there there is no reason to so i did try very hard . therapist: when you did try did you have the feeling were you getting sick ? patient: i did . yeah it wa an a it wa a bad a a any of my buddy but i definitely i mean i did i did feel well therapist: have your parent given you any option in term of like do they understand that your seems like you a little dependent on patient: yeah i mean they they do i definitely like i do hold anything against my parent i got you i have a pretty good relationship with them . i know what i doing is is good for me . and they they said that they would completely support me they they told me that they have a place picked out where i can go and that they be willing to pay for it and everything but they said if i you know if i do meet them halfway then it just that it like it they done . therapist: so they have a solution in a sense for what going on . silica is like a detox . patient: it is therapist: okay detox right . so they have a they have a solution to help get you off the heroin but there still there still a part of you that doe want to go that route . patient: i mean that you know i think i think i starting to come to term and it that it time to stop and it might be good that maybe i stopping so early . i know . i know . my friend have been doing it for a lot longer than i have . but i just yeah i do i do know if the detox gon na work . i mean it it hard for me to focus on like anything until sometimes until i get my next fix . therapist: right . so there there a few problem here . so so one is can you can you commit to going to detox and the second is even if you successfully complete that when you come back out if you can build void the power patient: right it tough right now cuz actually my my dealer life in my neighborhood . i mean he i mean he just like a few few house down . my my girlfriend life in our community too . and like he he on the way to her house . so a girl kind of just maybe pick it up on my way . and third third my bookbag and getting out my girlfriend bit and then maybe on my way back home i shoot up the buddy . so therapist: right . so you so really you running into them a you walk to your girlfriend house . patient: right . yeah . therapist: and he there and the temptation is great . and patient: i mean it like that house is kind of that actually where i shoot up a lot . so it like whenever it is therapist: in his house ? patient: right right . so it like whenever whenever i coming up to his house i like i start start getting excited you know like sir anticipating how how great it it gon na feel the next time . and it i know it like stuck with me i get i get excited when it a well a you therapist: know feeling so so it exploiter . a soon a you walking up to the wall a you getting ready to pas this house sumo like to all the way to your girlfriend you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement . what the thought that going through your mind ? patient: i like i kind of i just ca wait for the for the next hit . now i got pass how since my parent are giving me an ultimatum . and now it kind of mixed because i like man if i if i get to do that and somehow they find out like it it kind of all over for me . and then but on the other hand i thinking about how how great it gon na be . i just kind of like i planning in my mind how much i going to do and what kind of plan we have for the rest of the night . therapist: okay so you have a you have a few thing going on . do you think like is your plan right now to go into the detox ? patient: it is . yeah it yeah . i mean my my definite plan is to go into detox and if the detox work like i mean i think i can be done with it . but it just i do i do know if the detox can work . and i mean i never only tried to cut back that one time . and i mean i do know how good i be at it . you know therapist: let let presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you you would be one even you would be on heroin coming out of detox . patient: right right . therapist: are you worried at that point that you go right back ? patient: i do know if i go right back . like i think if i can get off at the detox actually work . so with that said do i think i could stay off it i think like my i think my craving will still always be there . but now that it like now that i come to the realization that some of the stuff that i can lose if i get caught i mean if i can get off it for good i do i do like i feel back . it might be hard like if i run into my buddy or something . therapist: that that the point of worry right ? patient: right . therapist: so there there is a concern that you you could you could go back if you run into them ? patient: right . therapist: if you could stay away from him . you think you increase your chance of being successful ? patient: i mean yeah definitely . i wo like there there so many like experience in this house . that that kind of to feed into the anticipation and the craving . i mean if that doe happen you probably help therapist: when you plan in term of going into detox ? patient: pretty soon i think i supposed to go on monday after the weekend . so like three day therapist: okay . so it it actually sound like what your parent have put in place you believe will work . right ? you have confidence that will work . and that your worry is what will you have is when you get out can you avoid it when your friend patient: right therapist: you do buy from anybody else other than your friend . patient: no no therapist: so so that really becomes the maybe one of your key goal here since since your cake . sound like you committed to the detox part . right and you know some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something you patient: no yeah if it work and then i can try . therapist: so it it preparing for life after detox patient: right ? therapist: and avoiding wait for the phrase people place thing through with with the addiction or or substance use . so in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend we and and where he life right which is unfortunately not far from you and in between because house in between your house and your girlfriend patient: right therapist: so is there a way it may seem a little odd but there a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend house . patient: yeah i mean there is this is kind of out of the way but i think yeah i could go there like a like a horseshoe path . i could . yeah i could . i could like go up the block and i like around the horseshoe and then and then i can like turn right and get her house there . therapist: she would never even see his house . patient: right right . therapist: have other option a well . so there that option . how about her coming over to where your parent that wa that ever happened before ? patient: um i mean yeah she she come over . so maybe if like maybe if i tell her that it you know help me out she can like she can make that walk and i be like it be easier therapist: because she can walk right by the house without problem patient: right right i if i are walking out of the house it be harder for me to actually do what i supposed to . so if i ca even leave and she come at i might be best therapist: and to get to work do you have to pas his house ? patient: no no i like i worked on the road . so i just drive like i drive all the way out to the community . therapist: so there kind of some like really there a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here which is just physically keeping you away from having to go by his house and sound like the only reason other than to to buy and use drug is to see your girlfriend . patient: right . therapist: there an alternative strategy here right ? she she come to you or you could go all the way around and then only round back to return . and to get back and forth to work . you do have to go by his house at all . patient: yeah i could do that . i gon na work . therapist: is there ever a time where he come to you ? patient: i honestly not that much . now . he obviously he doe . he doe really like to leave his house much . he he kind of going on always there . so that kind of he just deal out of there and then shoot up there . so he he stay in his house most of the time and he doe even come out . therapist: and we you know we know that there on my thought we talked about this before right that is on mac thought that lead to feeling and behavior . patient: right right . therapist: and can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe ha occurred ? not really . walking by his house but when you been in your house like this maybe it motivated you to go walk to his house patient: right . i bored . therapist: okay patient: yeah just straight up . i mean when when there nothing to do in the house my parent are gone . so it a it the best way to have fun . therapist: so you identified a thought that that directly connects to the behavior you want which is on board . so onboard lead to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom ? patient: right . therapist: is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment ? when you say board ? is there a depth of response to couplet a soon a this post detox . patient: right right . therapist: sound like that your plan . you sitting in your house detox is done . there no more you know we would hope withdrawal type symptom patient: right . therapist: the thought come upon you i bored . what it a self talk piece that could be interjected there . patient: um i think like if i if i remember to think what i do want to do when i think that i bored like i just kind of come up something else . so i right now my usually my two choice when i bored are either to go to my buddy house or go to my gril house you know across from my buddy . so maybe that could just be like one of the time i called my girl and be like hey can you just like come over ? we can do something like just kind of distract me from from like wanting to go over dance place you know ? therapist: so to the adaptive response call you girlfriend . patient: right yeah . therapist: on board and and she you know sound like what voice that she really supportive of ? patient: yeah yeah i mean she wa too happy with me doing it she doe use so i mean there there that social all she be on board for that . therapist: it seems like consequence motivates you . right . and that what brought you in today like to practice anyway . so i wondering if another adapter response response could involve you know i do want any any trouble . you know and you can substitute a lot of word in for trouble . there all kind of trouble that can occur from using heroin patient: right therapist: so getting kicked out of house i do want to you know i do want to get kicked out my house . i clean . and there something else i can do here other than drug patient: right therapist: like i thinking in time and your girlfriend might not be around . okay . right . so you still want to have you want to have adaptive response . that not necessarily tied to a person in case she is around . patient: right therapist: can use that one certainly that a good one when she not around . and you kind of revisit those consequence new adaptive response . do you think that going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house ? patient: yeah i do . i mean i like a of right now work scone good like school is going good . i do i really do want any problem . and i think like now if i do realize that if i if i do keep using it not just going to be something like that i do when i bored or like that i doing for fun it going to turn into like a problem that going to kind of affect everything else . so i think like if i just remember to tell myself like when i feeling bored if i just remember to tell myself like i do i do want to be out in the street and like especially i do want to lose my job . like i think telling myself those thing that will help remind me like kind of what at stake . you know therapist: good good . so it sound like you have some some adaptive response to use . nothing occurs to me is your parent around much patient: yeah i mean they my dad work a lot . my mom usually she work to a single part time job . so she usually like home at night . therapist: and night one of the time and you have gone over to your friend house patient: well it actually it more during the day it more kind of day . therapist: so she could be an asset in term of trying to stop you from leaving the house but only when she there . patient: right . therapist: and similar to your father you know so it really i guess we kind of narrow it down to when you home alone and particularly when your girlfriend not available that your highest risk time right ? patient: yeah . therapist: so we have the cognitive adaptive response to come employment what wa anything more behavioral we can do like can you can you go somewhere else ? patient: well i think like one of the one of the other thing i do to kind of clear my head a i like to go for a drive . so like if i if i start feeling bored i think maybe if i like get in my car and like i said all of that that his stuff . i just drive away like just physically leave the temptation . and then like from there i can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store like i can i could spend hour in there . so maybe if i can like i can remind myself to drive away go to the store and like maybe i can just kind of stay out there like enough till either like my girlfriend home or my parent come home . therapist: i think that a good i think it a good plan . yeah . and remember that the more we apply these adaptive response right what we hope is that you the risk decrease like your craving decrease your motivation to stay clean increase patient: right . therapist: so while it may be only convenient to drive someplace every time no one available and you have thought that might not be something i do forever . patient: right right . therapist: but that that minimize the risk for now . and we want to we want to focus on the short term first . and then we worry more about the midterm and long term patient: right ? therapist: then circumstance may change maybe you he reside there forever . maybe some of his work schedule change . maybe there are other adaptation you can make . patient: right therapist: but but for now i think this would be a good way to go . just keeping you away from the circumstance patient: right ? therapist: you definitely do want patient: right . therapist: so good news a few behavioral piece we have in here and then a few cognitive a well . so i want to see in a couple of day before we go into detox patient: okay therapist: so that we can practice some of these adaptive response are like good practice some at home . between now right a well . patient: right . yeah therapist: and these behavioral response a well . but we try to get them shored up before detox and i see it right after you come out a well . patient: okay . therapist: we make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining his adaptive cognitive response and his adaptive behavioral response . right . doe that sound like a plan ? patient: yeah definitely . i think that will definitely help . especially especially being in here and after detox . that would definitely definitely be the best therapist: i appreciate you coming in jesse and i see you in a couple day . patient: yeah . thank you . thank you . therapist: thanks .",

            "therapist: hi joe how are doing today ? patient: i am alright therapist: just alright ? patient: i mean obviously i not doing great i you know asked you to have this session we did we were scheduled for today . i just i do know i just i feeling you know depressed a usual but it just it stronger and i just feeling i just do want to wake up i just therapist: rough time of thing ? patient: yeah therapist: what wa causing it ? patient: not really . i mean it just the same except one you know like i just i feel like what the point ? i do feel like continuing on . therapist: you do feel like continuing with your life . patient: yeah kind of therapist: have you been having thought of suicide ? patient: i mean i think about what it would be like to just end thing . i think it would be a lot easier . but at the same time like i ca imagine doing it . but you know i ca say i have thought about it . therapist: so you have some thought about it what prevents you from doing it ? patient: i do know . i mean i guess i know what it would be like for my family . i do want to hurt them . therapist: they would be hurt ? patient: yes and it scary i mean the thought of dying is scary but the thought of going on is painful . therapist: so it almost sound a if by squaring it down a bit . patient: yeah i kind of feel like i stuck between a rock and a hard place . like i just do know where to go from here . therapist: have you worked out in a specific plan or so ? patient: no i mean you know you know i thought like if i were to do it you know way but not not specific because i just do think that i could do it you know like i do . i thought about suicide but i do like seriously consider it a an option . but it starting to like creep into my thought . and it never ha before so that i like kind of concerned about that . like i guess i know . sometimes people like really planted and but for me i it an i never really considered it before so it really scaryfor me . therapist: so this how long been going on this feeling ? patient: um i think like in the past couple of day it started you know more so and then like today it wa just like the first thought in my head and i could stop thinking about it and that why i wanted to see you because i just feeling i starting to feel like a little bit out of control . therapist: okay so and today and maybe the past few day been kind of new feeling that a new thought you do want to continue life continue living . but at the same time you do want to commit suicide . you do have a plan . patient: yeah i do want to i i really do want to but you know like i said i feel like i stuck between a rock and a hard place like it . it not i know it not a good option . i just like sometimes i feel like i so stuck . i just do know where else to go . therapist: so if we call it feeling depression right because that what we talked about before is the depression will go away ? do you think that would change your outlook on ? patient: definitely i think that is like the reason why i the reason why the thought of not living anymore come into my head is because of my depression because i just feel so like my emotion are out of control because i wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless that it make me wish that i wa dead . but if i did have that feeling then i would wish that i wa dead . because i know that my life ha value and i know that my family would want me around and i know there a future for me but my feeling make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless therapist: alright these suicidal ideation i know you you telling me you have had them before so i can appreciate that they scary . they could be scary even if you had had them before are fairly common with depression . and you it sound like what you really saying is you frustrated and you tired of being sick . and i think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset . when i see your life ha value . i want to try to hang on to that thought . after we done here today tell me what you have planned for u today . patient: well i did i did really have plan because i kind of you know came here feeling like i really needed to see you so i kind of put thing on hold but i mean i guess i would go home and and you know i not really sure . therapist: anywhere else you will go ? patient: no . but i mean i probably could go to my parent house if i needed to i could probably call them in and see you know it getting close to the afternoon so they get off work soon . therapist: can you do that for me ? can you go there ? patient: yeah i think that a good idea . therapist: and we kind of play by here from that point . i going to see you today . we we do some work today . well i see you again tomorrow . all right . so if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice given your thought and your feeling right now . have you ever have used the term contract for safety ? patient: i think you mentioned it before . i not really sure . therapist: okay . so what it mean is you kind of an only if it authentic i want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you going to be safe until i see you again right for the foreseeable future that you do have any intent or plan to harm yourself . can you make that promise to me now ? patient: yeah therapist: okay . all right . so give me a minute and i come back and overcome a bit today . and now i going to schedule you see tomorrow a well . patient: yeah . therapist: okay patient: thank you . therapist: thanks joe .",

patient: i i think he worrying for no reason . because i you know i for the last like week and a half i have been following my passion which is baking . and i did realize this before because i worked in an office . and i just realized that that not what i want to do with my life . and i know what i want to do with my life now and i never known before . so this is an amazing feeling . and what i want to do is i want to start my own baking business . and so what happened wa that a couple . two week ago my nephew had a bake sale . and i always i always been like baking but i always been like from the box or like from you know whatever . so i tried for the first time making brownie from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out . and my nephew thought i wa a hero basically i wa and so now it made me realize like i could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people . and like my college campus would be kind of cool if i could like put up something about like delivering the bakery like the dorm or like big good to dorm because you know college student love that type of thing . but so anyway so i wa thinking about long story short having this business and i would bake all these cooky and i wa gon na put up flyer because i do i not like at the point where i can get like an office space but i do need an office space because i have my apartment and i have everything i need in my apartment to bake everything i need . and i can also have a bjs membership . so go to bjs . and i can get everything i need in bulk . so like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff . so it not an issue if i just do it from my apartment . and so i wa putting up flyer and trying to promote my business and ha really been working on for the last week and a half and i feel great . and it amazing . and that basically it . therapist: alright so you feel like everything kind of going your way . hmm . and you really excited about the new business idea . i know that your brother wa a little concerned with how much you been spending on the business idea . and he mentioned some thing about different relationship you had that are new . patient: okay so there a couple that with that . so with the spending like i do think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin and i understand why he worried because like so at work well at the office job that i had like i got in trouble and because i obviously you need to make fire and i wa like oh like he doe realize i frugal . i smart . so i wa like i make the fire at work . and put them out of the work computer . so that i not having to pay like wherever like staple or something to go and print them out for me . so i got in trouble because it wa like for personal use and i wa using like the the work whatever . but like that what annoys me about it because like the new guy that i met which is the other thing with the relationship like this new guy is so supportive of my idea . i met him actually in a bakery which is like destiny . and he wa so supportive when i told him about what i wa planning . and actually the other guy that i wa talking to before and i been talking to him for a while he wa kind of like my brother and wa like are you sure this is something you want to do ? and like i do understand why you would say that someone who obviously sure of what they want to do . like i know i can do it . i know that i be successful like did they not taste the brownie at the bake sale ? like they were amazing . and so that kind of where i am and that why my brother worried but he should be because like i have all this played out . therapist: he worried that you do want to think this wa the new relationship you do know the guy too well patient: i mean i hooked up with him a few time like i know him pretty well . and i do think he understands like the connection that we have i guess a pretty strong one . therapist: so your brother just doe . in your mind he just doe get it . patient: no . and like he doe like pay attention to me when i talk . like i be trying to tell him about like the bake sale and or not the bake sale . well a little bit about the bake sale i can try to tell him about how successful it wa . and he just thought that i wa like bragging but i wa like it wa genuinely like a success . and then i tried to tell him about my business idea . and like he like trying to like brush it off . like it not a good idea . and that why so he just doe listen to me . so sometimes i try not to talk too much about it . therapist: have you noticed through all this any change in sleep pattern ? patient: i have been sleeping a much but i think that just because i so excited about this and like so . i been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipe and honestly ha really been an issue because i have been tired at all . i wa really the i have eat i felt rested . i get enough . therapist: notice you do feel rested . you have been sleeping a much . patient: no therapist: and you clearly seem like you in a good mood no no sadness right now at that patient: like i not gon na have sadness when you following your passion therapist: should be doing pretty well that way . have you ever been down or depressed ? patient: yeah yeah . in the past i have been actually not too long ago about four month ago i wa i wa hospitalized because i wa so down . but you know and i i do feel like that now . and i know what it feel like to be down and i do have any of that stuff . like i feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going right now . therapist: do you ever feel this way before ? kind of in a really good patient: no therapist: no . nothing like this . therapist: what do you think about all this one ? patient: honestly i just think it like getting to know myself and getting to know like what i want to do which is this you know culinary art therapist: it kind of realizing that it kind of changed my life patient: for the better for like really for the better therapist: all right and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work therapist: right ? how bad that turned out patient: pretty bad like i it wa like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but i not too worried about it because at this point i putting so much time into the baking business that if something go wrong with my like office job like i have this like in i sure that in a short a a month like i i be making money soon . and a lot of money because i know how much time i going to be putting into this how passionate i am about it . and i know that like i be able to make the money back that i put into it . so i not worried about it therapist: should have to worry about that . patient: yeah . therapist: any medical condition you know have a drug and alcohol you saving is anything like that ? patient: no therapist: are you seeing or hearing anything that other people ca see or hear ? patient: no therapist: no like that ? sure . so i know that you feeling pretty well . but i would like you to see a counselor maybe help you a you contemplate these different thing we been talking about . if you be if you be okay with talking to a counselor patient: i guess that be fine . therapist: you be okay with that . i get that set up . we just take a moment . and i want to thank you for answering my question . this ha been helpful . patient: you welcome .",

right ? i would like you to if you okay with this exercise tell me the first thing that come to mind like and you can buy say a word you can offer several response . but try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you . oh but doe that make sense ? patient: yeah . therapist: all right . so the first word is patient: structure responsibility . patient: repetition therapist: repetition . therapist: all right . let me give you another word relationship . patient: conflict power struggle . patient: disagreement . therapist: let me offer you another word therapist: work . patient: independence patient: freedom patient: able to express creativity . therapist: good alright . how about another word here ? power patient: of constant struggle patient: extremely controlling . therapist: so do you see any therapist: theme and in the word that you provided back patient: seems like everything is like really controlled and patient: structured therapist: controlled and structured ? therapist: what the source of that controlling structure ? is there a source of it ? patient: a lot of it may come from my fiance . now that i thinking about it . therapist: somebody told me you thinking patient: because i feel that he doe give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the thing that i would like to do like work and i think he should help more with the kid around the house and do thing and i should have to do everything . and i feel like that probably why i so frustrated because i felt that i do have any help . it like i single and i doing everything on my own . so this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming from therapist: so a you telling me this and you explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance what are you feeling ? patient: i feeling angry and disappointed . like i do really know if i want to further anything because well it be like this forever just like angry frustrated therapist: is a similar to the anger that you been experiencing recently . like at the dry cleaner place . patient: it far worse than it but it like i think that where why i always so upset and angry . therapist: serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what really causing the anger . patient: yeah cuz i feel alone at the same time completely . like i not in a fair relationship is like i in control and i do have freedom to do anything . i do have help and it just it laying a lot of stress on me . therapist: so is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you kind of realizing something that you did realize before patient: it because honestly i kind of i never really focused on that aspect of it . i kind of just thought that the way it should go . and i just thought i wa angry because i just hate bad deed . i never really looked deep into it because i try so hard to make everything in my family right . so i kind of really do pay attention i kind of ignore it . but now that i thinking and pointing out different thing than into how i really feel . therapist: so you feel this this kind of big moment in term of awareness . patient: definitely because i do think i would have like i said i think i kind of try to hide it and really do focus much on it because i want thing to be perfect . so they got a kind of ignore it . therapist: okay so maybe through this session you develop more insight about what contributing to the anger . patient: yeah definitely . cuz i would just go off for no reason at all and just later to think about like why did i even do it ? therapist: but but this source of anchor this relationship you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing ? yeah . where the other object of your ad ? if you were really sure patient: i wa sure at all . why . but with that i definitely could see the reason why . therapist: all right chess move . i feel like we made some progress here . and i like you to between now and next session if you comfortable with it kind of reflect on what theme have maybe come to the surface what information may have been revealed to you a little bit . and we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue . so that like a good plan . patient: yeah definitely . definitely . it good . therapist: well i appreciate you coming in today and i see you in week . okay . thank you .",
            "the patient ha difficulty controlling anger in everyday life . the patient feel they explode for little thing . they are upset that they feel angry . the patient feel they release more energy at kickboxing class . they do not what is causing them anger . the patient is frustrated and overwhelmed . the patient feel they have a lot of responsibility mainly take care of home kid and all household chore . the patient is asked to mention the first few word that come to mind and therapist summarizes that everything is controlled and structured . the patient feel the source for this maybe fiance since they feel all alone in the house work they do and would like to get some help from fiance . the patient feel angry and disappointed . the patient this anger is far worse than they felt before . they feel they are not in fair relationship and this is new information about themselves that ha been revealed . the patient is able to see why they are angry now . the patient is asked to reflect upon the theme that ha come to surface and explore further in the next session ."

            "therapist: today patient: i been working still on the fear of leaving the home for extended period of time like vacation . and it been a little harder recently because i have this plan trip with a friend of mine coming up in a few month and that kind of been weighing on my mind . therapist: whereas the trip to ? patient: georgia therapist: how long way patient: she want to go like six day yeah i not sure with work and school and everything i can make the full six day and plus i a little nervous to go that long . therapist: so that a long time for you . patient: it is yes . therapist: so when did you discover this trip wa going to be patient: actually last just a few day ago she messaged me and said hey you want to go with me and we go golfing and swimming . i love golfing . like i know i want to go . but i just had these just a little nervous about leaving therapist: a little nervous ? so when she made that call patient: i wa just a couple day ago wa the first thought he had kind of i ca go that long . that wa my first thought . that that too long . but he wa like wow this would be great . i want to go down there golfing so bad and get away from the cold weather . so i mean my immediate thought wa no not that long . but yes i gon na go . therapist: alright so so to kind of conflicting thought right . so one one is like never go that long six day way too long . and the other one is that would be enjoyable . you enjoy that ? patient: absolutely . therapist: yeah . so which way you leaning right now . patient: i want to go to go for six day . maybe just like a long weekend therapist: day ? patient: two would be ideal but the idea of it two three day yeah . therapist: so what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two day ? patient: i do know . i mean i always a a late teenager in my i always had just nervous to leave home i do a much a i love being home i love to travel to and you know do different thing . it just i guess i just afraid something to happen when i not around . therapist: not to you afraid something will happen to your your house or patient: well i have pet so we about them . my parent are getting older so i worry about them . mainly like my immediate family mainly i guess my dad because he had a history of heart attack and then my pet that such a for something to happen i will be there . therapist: and how about when you were younger ? you said this problem found for wa the same thing the same thing . so mostly family and now some pet patient: my pet then to see if that therapist: yes your feeling are there fighting one another . absolutely . and right now the feeling the thought anyway have you know i would like to go on the trip . is winning but the fear thought wa kind of dragging dragging you down . yeah . so what the sensation of anxiety here ? patient: yeah i get anxious . yeah my heart get feel like it heavy my chest feel heavy and i just all these thought go through my mind like you know i know my parent um i can watch my pet but they may not take care of them like i would i do know it just i mean that you know they always will take care of all my no but they miss me and they might tear my house up i do all these thought in my mind that seem crazy to me . therapist: so it seems like an endless stream of worry . yeah . surrounding family and pet . and what might happen . so really that that it right ? this is what might happen . it the uncertainty right ? so is anything ever happened ? patient: no no therapist: okay . so so far all worrying . and anxiety really ha paid me dividend . patient: yes . and now that i older when i wa younger i probably would like it overnight . but now that i older yes i do i just say i got to live my life and they be okay . i just try to tell myself they in good hand . if something happens somebody oh call me but then i feel like oh but i want to be hour away . i a plane ride away . and then i get thinking about that but i do go . therapist: but you did in the past patient: no therapist: so something changed . what changed ? patient: i do know . i really therapist: right ? so not sure what change but used to not go now you do go . so when you down there or wherever you go in the trip you feeling better like you enjoying yourself . but you also worried at the same time . patient: not too well . once i get there i usually okay . maybe the first night i get a little worried . and then maybe when i getting ready to come home i like a little anxious i ready to get home to make sure everything okay . therapist: and the rest of the time . patient: i usually okay . i get some alcohol involved . so he kind of limit my anxiety . but once i get into like playing the golf and all that i really do allow myself to enjoy it . it just it seems like it going and coming . that therapist: alright so the problem really is when you there . the problem is now leading up to it and maybe just the first half day your day when you there and maybe the last half day or two there . patient: it like a plane . like i do have a problem right like flying out . but it the thinking like while i waiting for the plane like whoa what if we what if a terrorist is on there ? what if we crash ? i think about all that before but once i there and on the plane is right take off . i fine . i completely fine . not anxious . it leading up to the actual event that make me anxious . therapist: i suppose anticipation . so that that the worst part . all right so the period between now when you leave it gon na be the worst part . patient: yes therapist: but she probably stock up . patient: probably . but i have changed my mind probably a dozen time before actually say yes . therapist: and when you do go on twitter . patient: yeah . therapist: something could happen . certainly sure . but it ha so far patient: i do know . i try not to think that for therapist: alright so you you return ? patient: yeah . still doe stop me from worrying when i get these trip planned . therapist: yeah so the probability of it really doe . that doe alleviate the worry worry still there . right . even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doe patient: no not at all therapist: that doe leave anything at all . patient: like i got ta get my house cleaned up and make sure my animal or everyday have enough food and i preparing to leave . therapist: preparing is productive right ? yeah that make sense . yeah . well how would the thought see you feel more connected to the warring ? patient: probably like like i want to i want to say i do know i really it kind of a word . like i want to like i ca say bye not to my parent or i ca you know say bye enough to my pet like i feel like i like i do i do know i do really care . that i guess part of the problem . i do know what i connecting it to . therapist: so if you do tell them goodbye enough time . patient: yeah i do know maybe i sound so . therapist: oh it sound like maybe if you do say if you do say goodbye enough time and settled that that you feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it patient: maybe . therapist: so that so that the focal point of this thing night in some way . right ? patient: let me go for a few day . therapist: and the way you start to let go is when you tell them patient: yeah . therapist: so so what do you find yourself doing ? you say goodbye and then then leave and then come back ? or patient: do i just finally say bye ? i talk to you later love you . you know i check in when i land or whatever and then that it . then it like i just have to try to breathe and just put those thought behind me . because once i say it it like okay that it . i gone . therapist: but you but your thought are still coming thought are still come in and say you should have said goodbye one more time . patient: no . i just know that doe come to my mind therapist: that you did say goodbye well enough . patient: i do know . therapist: the property wa the property of saying goodbye . this you feel like you not doing well enough . patient: maybe it just the fact that i leaving . i should leave . say that you know maybe i feel like i maybe it just the guilt of leaving . therapist: so the act of leaving itself leave shoot guilty . and what are you guilty of ? patient: not being there if something happens . therapist: so abandon patient: maybe therapist: for a short time neglecting them for a short time . patient: probably maybe i did feel a little guilty . therapist: and now you in more of a caregiver role than you were then . patient: maybe a little bit i mean i always been . i the youngest of mine me and my sister but my parent have always looked up to me to be the responsible one and make sure everything taken care of so i probably kind of loud myself . to take on that role of the caregiver moreso or be at the more responsible one of the two . therapist: so to be the responsible one there need to be guilt when you leave i guess patient: maybe i should stay home and be responsible person and they do make me feel guilty . they say go have a good time . your baby ugly . okay we take care of what i mean . i know they in good hand . that that what make it so difficult . i know they be okay . but i just feel like a probably should go . therapist: so there not another person driving the skill towards you . that me . just coming in from the side . patient: yeah . therapist: so if i if i leave well i responsible . and if i leave something bad will happen . and that be on me . patient: now when they to fix it or take care of it or make it better like i put it on somebody else that have to do with that . yeah . therapist: so fear of being caught a irresponsible . patient: maybe yeah . therapist: and you could be a few left to just take you a day travel or whatever however far away . patient: yeah . therapist: right . so yeah but that that still doe help relieve anxiety now when you come back because patient: no not really . because it like i want immediate access . like i want to be able to be right there within minute if they need me . therapist: have you ever taken a trip that wa like within patient: i mean not it not a bad but yeah there back there . stay with u . for an overnight there some of the way up sometimes i thinking i should just stay home . or i could be right in the same town sometimes that if i i wake up at five in the morning i just get up and go home because i just get really start feeling really anxious and i want to be home . therapist: so the closer you are it help a little bit it sound like a good part of the anxiety is still there . so it really doe matter where you go . it the fact that you not home . the fact that you not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it . patient: when i work hour shift and i have to work the overnight i will most of the time take my break and go there between the chuck on pima benson . therapist: so at that a long shift . so a hour shift . at what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thought ? patient: probably usually like six seven hour into it just depends like now it getting dark so when it kind of get dark and if i do leave the light on or something i get a little anxious . i feel like i need to go home and leave the light on and you know just let my pet know i coming back kind of weird but i know they miss me . and then but if i busy then i do really think about it . so if you know if i busy at work doing something i do really think about until i stop what i doing right slow down and i thinking wow i got more hour or eight more hour . sometimes i go home sometimes they do . sometimes it worse than others . therapist: right so if you busy at work the same reality exists meaning your pet are alone . but the way you responding to it is different . yeah you le anxious . patient: maybe because i know i close . i can get there . i know i in control . we be able to go there . therapist: well i buddy let say not at work let say when you on the vacation in those day in the middle when you enjoying yourself . is that a distraction like the more you enjoy yourself the last year patient: yeah . therapist: but the same reality exists there alone . so really it your way ofwhich way of viewing thing that leading to anxiety . it not necessarily what actually happening . patient: it my perception therapist: your perception of what happening . what could happen . i guess in this case not so much what is happening is what you worried . could could patient: definitely therapist: because nothing happened yet . patient: no not yet . therapist: so how many ? well there i guess there a few different . there a few different issue here . right ? how many vacation you take a year . patient: i do really take long vacation i taken only i only taken like two week long vacation ever . for like five six day and i wa fine . well same anxiety when i wa younger . and now it more like long weekend or you know a night here or there i do really take long vacation but probably maybe three or four time a year i like go away overnight versus just not just a friend house like an actual vacation where i go into the city or something therapist: sort of small proportion of the time so just looking in term of probability you risk is very low because you not quite that much . but the other issue is that even at work you still having the same feeling and even for short trip you still have the same feeling . so you really limiting thing xietymuch of the time patient: yeah therapist: it been this way for year patient: probably since a teenager and he ha stopped me i always where every now i work more than ever i the more it doe stop me from working the kind of overtime working three job doe stop me and but i mean like i said in a a teenager early it did i would just be like on my way out somewhere to go stay the night my boyfriend wa like nope i ca do it not to come home . but now that doe happen . and may not i may not go for a week long vacation but i go for a few night . therapist: so you functioning ? patient: oh yeah . therapist: approved . yeah he actually pretty good . working a lot sound like patient: yeah . therapist: because this uncomfortable anxiety . this is painful for you . patient: yeah i mean it doe like so it doe really seem to stop me from working obviously because i work it just the leading up to leaving for work or therapist: going on vacation . alright so let say patient: well think about making sure i have everything i need for work you know do have i usually take my dinner . therapist: do you feel le anxious when you with those prevention okay so that help . right ? so physically preparing your house so that your pet are safer that help you . so what else is going through your mind so you do that right you take all the precaution you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything . so what the next thought ? patient: just got ta go to work . i just think about i come home later . you know if i get a break . i mean usually i do especially if i do the overnight a i got downtime so run home and check on and then i off to work and then i kind of forget about it . and then i said some light is burned out not every night i come home and check off but some night i just get started feel anxious and get thinking about them and i go on the trip . therapist: so every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them but you could leave patient: for now from out working with client . yeah so what therapist: happens then term of thinking and feeling ? patient: i do dwell on it because my focus is with the client . so it just kind of think about it i need to get home but you know and i just focus back on the client i do let it overwhelm me or therapist: well just so it doe change your function but society ha their anxiety associated with patient: it go away . i mean i want what i thinking about but then it go away . therapist: alright so depending on what you thinking about that can change the level of anxiety you experiencing . patient: there something or yeah . therapist: okay so there that is the that is the thought you having something like that patient: about older cat . i mean he really old something cool . you know what if you know he something happened to hell i mean i do honestly thinking i dying but i think you know what he need because he ha he really old . so i do think about him . therapist: i still have that you have that thought like patient: yes . therapist: so you can see the power of thinking and all this right . so the reality of your cat health and well being ha changed the way you view it a change the way you think about it . so we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response right ? so the thought you having now that lead to the anxiety we believe could lead to anxiety . they automatic right ? they just popping in your head . right ? it triggered by certain thing like getting ready to leave for work and and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something . we have the cat right . but that an automatic that just come without like you ca necessarily stop right ? patient: just come naturally when i getting ready to leave . therapist: then the anxiety is right there . so the adaptive response we also call self talk . that that a thought that you can give that you can create consciously . right ? you can think to yourself so it not automatic . it not an adjustment of an automatic thought . it a thought that you can deliberately think almost like repeating a sentence that you memorized you can at will choose to do that . that make sense . so i want to make sure i draw the distinction . some thought just pop in . other thought you deliberately like when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response . it can counter the feeling caused by the automatic thought essentially . patient: you challenging you disputing that automatic thought this be my own thought . therapist: you just spinning your thought . yeah . so you know and i want you to work with me to develop these adaptive response . i want you to have most of the site all the site you want and because i think that you can develop one that are useful to you but just to give an example when you have thought that you know the older cat can be sick right ? and adaptive response could be or could be wide wide variety of thought but one could be it not likely . right ? like you know or if it is likely that you know he probably be okay . if it a he or she okay ? he probably be okay till i get home . another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened . but i have my work responsibility and at some point i have to leave the cat alone . patient: i do tell them that i tell them thank them and i feel like them that well doe someone want sometimes i run from me when i try to kiss them goodbye . and i like oh no what i have to go to work because you will have to eat . i know it sound silly but i do tell him that and then i kind of think it doe . most thing . i think i did realize that kind of what i wa . but i do do that sometimes . therapist: so you actively responding . patient: yeah but i did realize that what i wa doing . but yeah i do say that to myself to them . yeah . therapist: well i think that a productive adaptive response . i mean you know you right . if you do if you do earn income then they have worse problem . patient: yeah i ca take care of them being left alone . therapist: so really good working . you you being more of service to them and protecting them more so patient: yeah that true . i never thought of it that way . therapist: so that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this this feeling of anxiety patient: and then there time i think you know they just cat are probably the last to go on . therapist: so they not striking you a anxious when you get home . patient: yeah . well sometimes sometimes sometimes after a hour shift yes i have one of them . she wo show me let me sleep the first hour she literally were around again and stuff . and i take it and she mad because i been gone but she fine . therapist: she continues to survive despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving . so that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor . but sometimes they asleep when you get home . so patient: yeah that true . therapist: how bad could it be for them ? patient: yeah . and they do know . i worrying or anxious . they could care le like they do believe no it not bothering them . i mean therapist: yeah i mean their level awareness clearly different than than yours . right . so yeah i mean that another good adaptive response that you know much higher level awareness whereas you not sure that have any awareness that you experiencing anxiety ? or maybe a little bit with a one cat who run or think they do ? patient: and that just an animal person but i think they do but yeah i probably give them think they have more feeling than what they probably really do . but they my kid i treat them a kid my kid are all god are important too . yeah therapist: absolutely . so it understandable that you would be anxious and have concern and but it also seems like you did make preparation to elevate their chance of having a successful experience right being okay . patient: yeah . therapist: so you implement behavior that are practical and that i worked in making the house safe and keeping the plant away from them and so i think one route here if you okay with it would be to use work a like the first point i know you have the trip . i know that that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst but you have more chance ? well one way you have more chance to test out these step response at work because it more or le a daily thing right ? five day a week or whatever it is . so some of those adaptive response that we kind of worked on together right ? you could apply those . and you know think about that the response are not always short . right ? the automatic thought could be short . it can even be image do not necessarily even complete sentence right ? like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation . so it not necessarily spelled out in english like a sentence but adaptive response . well they could be image too but the one i talking about are really sentence that you repeating back consciously to yourself . so it important to have them prepared and ready to go . so i often ask client to kind of write them out and have them available . so that when that thought come about and it seems like you pretty good at identifying you know what thought are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you memorized initially you read the automatic thought i mean the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought . okay might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and i found that it change how often and how intense to aback thought come in . conscious thinking adaptive responding doe that make sense ? patient: that u . because like i said i kind of said these thing to myself anyway i just did realize that what wa probably lessening the anxiety because i do say that thing those thing to myself pretty frequently when i say i have to go to work or else you guy wo be able to take care of did even dawned on me that that therapist: you already adapted yeah you already used cognitive behavioral technique in a way to reduce anxiety . so what we really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you already been doing to achieve some success . patient: that make sense . definitely yes . therapist: so if you could between now and next session write down some of the adaptive response that we discussed the one you already used and and then work to identify the automatic thought at work and then come up work to identify them and then consciously repeat those those that the response back when you have those thought okay so you really repairing self talk adaptive response with the automatic thought that thought come right ? and then you have the adaptive response . and you repeating it you know it an internal you pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud although that would surely be okay to not know your coworkers you know respond something like that . patient: sorry . no . i mean i threatened to put a camera in the house . so i can like there a thing you can you can remote access to your house and there a button your animal can push and call you . and i talked to him at work . i like well my cat call me . i really thought about it seriously that i could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home i could just look in and see what they doing . i have thought that some of my co worker know i ca worry about them . so yeah they would help support me and not be so anxious . probably . therapist: yeah . and and putting in a security type measure . you could lessen anxiety or it could create anxiety patient: but make it worse therapist: and i do know which you know . so i think if you okay with it we start with the adaptive response . patient: yeah i rather do that . therapist: see how that work out . and we have other option . putting security system in such to shy out in the future if necessary . let try the adaptive responding . then trying to keep track of how well it work for you like what your what your thought and feeling were . after you applied it patient: should i like try to measure my level of anxiety ? absolutely . okay . therapist: yeah . so you know maybe like a one to with being the worst okay and measure it when you first had that experience of it . i pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately you experienced it for a long time . you suffer with it for a long time . and then after applying the adapter response especially after a few minute applying a few time maybe shoot for one see what it is that and note that again the beginning of might not see much of a change at all . right ? so be persistent with it . okay . give it a chance to work and see how it doe . okay . we start there and we kind of review how you do that . and then we work toward the thing analyze the bigger stressor right ? and we see what we can do in term of planning adaptive response for that . okay . so a good plan . yes .",
            "the patient ha difficulty leaving home for extended period of time like vacation . the patient explains a scenario where they are seen to have conflicting thought of to go and not to go . the patient ha parent and pet to take care of . the patient get worried if something might happen to them when they are away . the patient feel le anxious if they are busy at work since they can reach home but not the same during a vacation . the therapist confirms depending on what the patient think it can change the level of anxiety . the therapist advises to use self talk to overcome automatic thought of anxiety and discus adaptive response useful to the patient . the patient is asked to develop different adaptive response and read the upside of adaptive response to counter the automatic thought and is requested to try this week and note the adaptive response down . the therapist also request the patient to measure their anxiety level ."

patient: my teacher all seem to think i doing well . they actually i see to get good feedback on my assignment but i feel like i feel like i just to make sure i doing well . i really focus on like the detail like making sure that the instruction are really clear like i doing everything like perfectly a an instructure instructor want because i really afraid that you know if i not really clear on what the assignment is then maybe i wo do it the right way . therapist: alright so before when you got a you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in term of like the detail in the assignment that you are now . you trying to get more information about the assignment you working harder to get the same grade that used to get before patient: right like i find myself like emailing the teacher like almost like obsessively like trying to to clarify the assignment and to make sure do they think i doing well in class and and what not . therapist: so when you when you having this feeling that i guess it a feeling of anxiety or stress yeah . what going through your mind ? what are you thinking about ? patient: well i guess i just feeling that you know i worked really hard this whole program and i do want to mess it up now or you know because if i do get these grade and i feel like what wa the use if i met then i going to be ruining all this hard work that i done this whole program if i kind of if i do maintain that level of you know like you said precision i feel like like that i let myself down or that i a failure because i i just slacked off at the end of the program and it so close to being done . therapist: so what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failed patient: probably le than an a . anything other than a therapist: right below an a is a minus ? patient: i mean i guess i would be okay with that but i would be really happy with it . therapist: what about a plus ? patient: i would be that excited about that . therapist: a b ? patient: i would be happy with that . therapist: no no it be worse . okay . so an a you can tolerate an a minus you not exactly sure but you think you could patient: yeah . therapist: but a b plus and a b ? patient: to me like like an a minus i would maybe be okay with but like below that like to me like a b whether it like a b minus a b a b plus it all b and that not an therapist: so what would it mean to you if you received a b ? patient: that i did try hard enough but there something else i could have done to to do better that i wa like slacking or i did read the direction right or i did have enough response or make my paper long enough . i just did do enough . therapist: but you did try hard enough that you did do enough . what would it mean if that were true ? patient: if i did try hard enough that i wa lazy . therapist: that you were lazy ? patient: yeah that i could have tried harder and i did . so why did i try ? i did maybe i did care . i wa lazy . kind of like what the use ? if you not gon na try your best and why try it all ? therapist: okay now we we talked before about automatic thought and cognitive distortion right in other session and one of the cognitive distortion is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and aaron thinking is when you think of everything in term of like black or white all or nothing ? so sound like you have a little tolerance for like an a minus you not completely there . but generally it kind of an a of some type right ? or you not interested . right . so we get down to you did try hard enough and if that were true the new would be lazy . right ? which you know having senior these last few session is clear to me . you not lazy . but that the body . patient: yes . therapist: now it seems that earlier in your earlier year in the program this wa the acer effortless for you but you have to work a hard for them . patient: yeah therapist: what what do you think ha changed ? patient: i not quite sure . like it did stress me out a much in the beginning of the program . like i really like school . but now i feel like i static because it anxiety producing for me because you know i constantly worried therapist: you mentioned part of it wa you can get close to the end right . so is there anything else ? patient: well the only thing i can think of is we have the same student throughout our program . but i guess this semester there a new student in the program and i know that you mentioned and it seems like she kind of really stressing me out . and also well see throughout the program i kind of considered myself like to be the student who got the best grade and there this award at the end of the program for doing really well . and i kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because i felt like that would show that i really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me . i think you know it would show people who viewed did that you know i really busted my butt and and did a good job in this program . and for the whole program so far you know that wa me like that wa i wa kind of the front runner i guess for this award . and this semester there a new student and then come to find out like she had a . in her other program . so therapist: so if i reading you right you you really did have any competition for this award that you were aware of . right ? and now you feel like you really do patient: right like i feel like the pressure on like i felt like i tried so hard this whole program and now like this new person come in and she might want a different me so i really need to go above and beyond to make sure that i still on track . therapist: i paradoxically that caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you still getting the a which are working harder to get the a patient: right . and it causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it not a enjoyable for me a it once wa . therapist: so what would it mean if you could get the award if you did with the what the name of the new wa first name with a new choice choice ? okay but of choice once award and you did want me ? patient: i guess part of me feel like them . why did i do the program ? if you know part of me feel like if you not going to be the best why try ? so if if she got the award over me then it kind of like why did i work so hard this whole time like i could have been slacking this whole time and just skated by so why did i bust my butt ? if it wa all for nothing ? i do have anything to show for it . therapist: so it all or nothing if you do win the award . patient: i mean i guess it not the only thing that matter so part of me feel that way sometimes that i have these thought that if i do try my hardest and do well and win this award then why do i try so hard the rest of the time but like it negates all the positive thing . this that this you know kind of like the end result like if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose you know at the end . therapist: right but you not really losing a race because you would still graduate ? patient: yeah . therapist: you you just not getting a word which you would like right and which would be great . right and certainly accomplishment . but the reason you came to the program wa to get the degree patient: right and even know about the award until probably like the second year anyway so that wa the reason i entered . but therapist: but it now it now taken on some importance for you winning award ha been a real goal . patient: yeah . therapist: so with the new student choice coming in i have this increased competition . patient: right . therapist: and that causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade . all right . so a we talked before you have a tendency to be i mean this a a compliment a little perfectionistic . right . i do think it necessarily a bad thing . it is taking too far it can be right it can be not useful . ever hear the phrase perfect is the enemy of good . no . doe that make sense what that might mean ? patient: yeah . therapist: yeah . so this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well . right ? patient: right therapist: you still getting the a but it called the anxiety and you working hard and patient: right now i not even i feel like when i read like i so stressed with it from reading the right thing and memorizing every word that i not retaining all the information so it could and it starting to like impact school . therapist: so is there any way that you can not win the award and still walk away ? having accomplished worthy goal ? or doe it have to be the award or none of this wa worth it ? patient: i mean it kind of sound silly when you when you reflecting it back to me how you know that i have to read the word like i i think that it make sense . you know that wa my goal going into it . you know why doe it matter so much to me that there different degree of success . i think if you said before that is not all about the award i think i would be happy with just you know getting the degree and all the stuff that i learned . and i would feel like it wa if i did get the award rather i would feel like it wa still a worthwhile journey . but in the moment sometimes it really upsetting at the thought of not getting the award . but that a possibility . therapist: your word validates all the hard work you done . patient: right exactly . therapist: and in your mind losing the award invalidates all the hard work you done right ? but in reality there probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray where you still an excellent student you still graduate you just do have an extra plaque hanging on the wall whatever the word is right . that really all you be missing . right ? patient: yep therapist: with this award have any impact on employment ? patient: i do think so i am thinking about i do think of a long term many people would know about it besides me or if i put it you know on a resume or something but i do think it would make that much of a difference . therapist: and you did know about it when you first came in and you already working hard . patient: right at the beginning i did even know about it . therapist: so in a sense and of course we ca do this for the sense of you could forget about the award . right ? you probably win it . patient: right right . therapist: because you already doing so well . but the thought of this potential failure right away the word that holding you back patient: right it make me it make me paranoid to make mistake or to try and take risk or to really you know do well because i so worried about judgment like from my teacher if i doing well enough . therapist: yeah there no there no tolerance for any type of mistake ? patient: right . right . therapist: so so now that with the award out there you really feel like you ca make any type of mistake or you just go right to to a catastrophe ? patient: right like i walking on eggshell and i just expecting my grade to tank if i if i kind of like deviate from that line . therapist: so free so for you to feel better about this one way i guess right would be to not help have to not place so much value in way . patient: it really hard . therapist: yeah you really want that . and it would be great . and that okay . right ? we talked about the adaptive response before right ? what are what your automatic thought you have when you sitting there and trying to get every assignment right and you you kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award wa the automatic thought that come to mind ? patient: if i you if i want when i just doing the work therapist: yeah when you doing your work and you sense that anxiety come on right a you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award right ? like it losing it really ? what going through your mind right that moment ? patient: i guess i just kind of like running through a checklist . did i do this ? did i do this ? did i do this ? making sure i did everything that wa expected of me therapist: to ensure that you gon na get that award ? patient: right . therapist: right . so at a higher level one of your thought is i must win that award . patient: right . therapist: doe that make sense ? i mean that that probably somewhere . is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment that statement or kind of well that an absolute statement right ? i must win that award . is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought patient: that i must win the award ? therapist: yeah . patient: i guess i could say that you know this the award is something local to my university and no one going to know about it in the grand scheme of thing . so it wo really impact future employment or what my colleague think of me . you know if i if i do get the award that they wo think le of me . therapist: okay so so you could say it be nice to win the award . but in the end it not really gon na make the difference in my life in term of my career patient: right . therapist: and and that a fair adaptive response right ? you do want to win it right ? truthfully and it would be nice to win it right . who doe want to win the award right ? but if you do you were still good student . you still gon na be a good connection and your career still good before . do you believe in that adaptive response ? do you believe that adaptive response is true ? patient: i feel like sometimes i do . and then sometimes it really hard in the heat of the moment to kind of talk myself down from that that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment right ? i not doing well . i going to get to be in this class i going to lose this award . so i feel like it start . it hard in the moment to spiral out of that . therapist: so what percentage of the time do you believe that adaptive response is true ? patient: maybe like half the time therapist: so of time ? patient: right ? depends on what going on in my stress . therapist: and the other half you not really buying . patient: right therapist: okay . all right . so what advice well let use choice right ? choice in the same situation in a sense in that she well maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award a well patient: i do even know she know about the award . therapist: let assume . let assume she know about it . right ? he in a similar situation . what advice would you give her ? she kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are . patient: yeah . i think i would tell her that you know the rest of the class see that she doing well . her teacher give her positive feedback . so all science would point towards that you doing really well and you being very successful in the program that you getting positive feedback from them . so that all the sign the feedback is telling you you doing a really good job . therapist: your advice to her seems positive and uplifting . mostly your advice to her is more positive uplifting what you telling yourself internally patient: definitely it is . therapist: so if that advice adequate . i feel it is adequate and appropriate for her . why is it adequate probably for you ? patient: i do know sometimes i feel like i just hold myself to a higher standard than i hold other people to like if some a friend of mine like joyce would come and tell me the same situation you know i be able to give her a whole bunch of you know suggestion or some positive feedback but it really hard for me sometimes because i hold myself to a higher standard than other people . therapist: but you would agree your advice to choice a you frame it to me is useful right ? but you just having trouble applying that to yourself ? patient: yes . therapist: smooth . that what you need to work on a bit . so you can kind of see the logic of all this but your feeling do match . patient: correct . make sense in my head and i would know what to tell someone else but i do always believe it . when i say to myself therapist: alright so here what i want you to do . you familiar with the thought record that i introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feeling and you explained all this to me i want you to actually complete one thought record . patient: okay therapist: i know after having set it all might seem like doubling the work . but i think it something change when you write something down . okay i have to face it on paper . and also it a good tool to remember exactly what you thinking . and then work through the adaptive response section and their smile at the bottom of thought record question you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response . and maybe write out a few different one . but there plenty of room on the forum . you see it right patient: right . therapist: that actually the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive response that the response do have to be short . like yours wa short . there really good they can they can be long and they can so be realistic like i like to win . it would be good to win . but alice should have to be successful . patient: okay therapist: i thinl the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success okay ? it doe have to be completely positive . okay ha to be realistic and useful . and a importantly you have to believe it . okay there a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in . okay i know we look at that from week to week and you know a we move closer to your graduation hopefully it bring you some relief for missing anxiety . patient: okay therapist: that sound like a good plan ? patient: hmm therapist: thanks . patient: thanks .",

            "therapist: hello . sam how you are doing ? patient: i good . how are you ? therapist: i doing well . thanks for asking . so you here at the agency today to seek counseling service ? patient: yeah . my bos sent me over . therapist: your bos said sure ? patient: there wa this issue with a couple of the people that could relate to my idea and my bos solid ha been kind of you know not working super well . so she wanted me to come over and talk about therapist: she want you to come over and talk about your relationship with your coworkers ? patient: um i think more just so that you know my idea were just kind of higher than what they could really understand so maybe learn how to like how to talk to other people so that they can understand me . therapist: okay what would you mean by higher like your idea patient: are higher you know just a little bit more intelligent you know i just at a level that other people ca always reach to you just you know like just a little bit higher sometimes a lot higher but just on this team they just could understand you know my language or what i wa saying and it could see the vision that i had . therapist: okay so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this wa like a project you working on ? and your bos recognized this difference and thought that that the counselor may be helpful . yeah ? patient: yeah . yeah . um i think it good you know so that my bos is happy that i went but i think it could also be useful in the sense of you know other people are jealous of me a lot and they just ca really relate to me . so it might be you know great to learn how to relate you know like kind of understand what they going through at their level . therapist: again you stay at their level . so are you meaning again that they kind of below you with skill ? patient: yeah they just they have they have accomplished a much they have you know they do know a many people they not hanging out with those prestigious rank you know they have been educated to the quality that i have been . so they just sometimes it hard for them to understand where i coming from or you know what i can see happening . therapist: okay so counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively . patient: yeah so i think you know so i can even better you know i here but i want to be like here . therapist: when you say you here at the first level patient: maybe like a seven but i want to like blow it out . the park you know like if is here i want to be higher than that . therapist: how would you plan on accomplishing that ? patient: well you know i always getting recruited for these really prestigious class and to speak place and people are always calling i a really large social medium presence when people are constantly asking me for advice you know just about everything because you know i just accomplished so much that i can really help people because i just you know i just been really lucky to just be good at so many thing . therapist: okay so it sound like you you have a lot of stress . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: and maybe from your understanding that people were just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many thing . patient: yeah . you know like sometimes people just it hard to admit that you just not a good or like you ca do it . maybe you do want to admit that i think i make them uncomfortable because i can . therapist: so calcium help you to relate to them in a way that so how would they have a more productive way ? how would they describe you ? you know given this level of difference on this you talking about how would they describe you if i were to ask them if i could ask them . could you describe sample ? patient: would they say ? i think they would say that i have a lot of people that look up to me that i excellent at my job that you know like i should really be vice vice president if not president but i mean i do own the company . but i should really have a more significant position . that a lot of the presentation that are happening that i could probably do but they do want to you know other people need opportunity but it would it would be clear for everyone if i just did them . therapist: would it be easier ? patient: yeah you know easier better more people . it would just be it would be a great presentation if i did it . so we just cut away all the other stuff . therapist: all those stuff . that what your coworkers would include ? patient: yeah therapist: yeah . thing that maybe detract from them . patient: right . like if you know if i wa doing the sale pitch we could blow it out of the park . i mean we be multimillionaires by now . so you know it would get rid of all that you know the grunt work type of stuff if i just did it myself therapist: doe it frustrates you that you not calling for every task ? patient: you not recognized sometimes but i gotten really good at reminding people that they should be calling on me for every task . because i you know sometimes you just have to show them you know i better than that person or i could do it better . and i really good at that type of communication . so i been able to secure a lot of position that were given to me at first because they realize like oh she better at it . so they can see your talent . therapist: so they recognize you most of the time . patient: no i mean most of the time . yeah therapist: how long have you been with this particular employer ? patient: um maybe like six month six month maybe ? eight month . okay . therapist: can you tell me about the job you had prior like what happened there ? patient: an ai algorithm . they so i got it i got it to a really you know large leadership position . and then you know the other vp could really see see what i wa going for . she could relate to me and she you know she she wa from the same type of like collegiate background that wa kind of an issue . so i just outgrew what they had to offer . and then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with the you know it wa just it wa just fantastic . so i just had to make a move that wa more strategic for me . and you know that i could that i could even reach more . you know i did i did want to be satisfied there . therapist: you want to you want to shoot higher . you want to accomplish something greater ? patient: yeah . therapist: more . so more stuff . you already achieved some level of popularity . patient: yeah . therapist: alright so your last ploy or the one before the place you work now you just outgrew that . can you tell me how that interaction went ? like ? did you quit ? or did they encourage you to leave ? like what happened to kind of the last moment of that job ? patient: um well i mean therapist: so you initiate it and you quit . at the same time . they had a few issue with type issue they have . patient: they just said i you know i talked too much or something like that or i think there wa an issue with somebody i wa working with or something . but it wa really it wa another situation that just did . we just we were we were communicating well but in the end i had to do what wa best for me . so because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back but i wa already here so that i wa gon na go back there . therapist: so i have to quit the pursuit you to come patient: yet for them again . yeah . which i told them wa gon na happen . therapist: you predicted that when you left patient: yeah it wa like you gon na you gon na miss me cuz i the reason this company is flourishing . therapist: so what did you tell them when they offered you patient: the chargeback that i wa had gotten a phenomenal job and it wa way better and that they lost it and they could just deal with it . therapist: so you rejected them at that point okay . patient: yeah . and i you know i want to make my bos happy but i feel like it would be good . you know i do want to make people feel bad because they inferior to me . and because they not a successful . so if i could learn how to even talk with them so that i not you know so they do feel bad about themselves . therapist: it your bos putting i mean she encouraged you to come here today . is she putting any pressure on you ? like is this something that strongly encouraged mandatory ? patient: i think it strongly encouraged . i think she ha a promotion for me in mind . so it probably just to set me up for that . therapist: so she trying to help you for the future . another advancement . so sam i going to get you on the calendar is to see a counselor open later this week . is that work for you ?

patient: it just tight feeling that i have i just experienced it difficult to put into word but just it just doe feel good . therapist: so let shift it to body where in your body you feel this type feeling ? patient: i think it it in my chest . therapist: so that a hot area feeling around the heart . and what is there in that heart and you pay attention to that that area in your heart ? what what do you find ? what sort of thing ? patient: yes it just really just a compressing feeling . therapist: i noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feeling . and i would like to suggest if you can say instead of being it and see what happens in your body so go ahead patient: you actually want me to say okay yes . my chest feel very tight . i feel very frustrated angry angry . therapist: so that what coming up frustration anger . so what are you doing this moment with your anger a you said to me right here to chest this moment ? patient: just accepting it therapist: once you accept that anger inside you what else do you do with that anger having accepted ? patient: it it just noticing you saying it again . therapist: use the word hi . it a thing that to acknowledge this is you know something out there we do a lot something very strong . so it a safe way to put it . but if you say i feel angry patient: i feel angry . therapist: but who do you feel angry at ? patient: my ex husband therapist: you ex husband ? patient: hmm yup therapist: sandra having just explore some of your feeling around the situation you have i going to suggest that you speak to jeff on an empty chair . this may be a little uncomfortable . but it helped me to facilitate a process where i become an observer and you be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with . and i be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the thing that we could do to change process okay . it been jeff and your imagination that the massive jeff we here . i bring a chair . okay . welcome jeff . i mean i welcome jeff . and and there jeff . imagine his face look like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy . and then when you ready to just say whatever come to you at that moment this moment spontaneous . patient: jeff i feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the child in . i think you understand how hard it is at time and the thing that i have to explain to them about about this situation . it bother me that you do go out of your way to spend extra time with the child and i really believe that in the future they they will come to to really resent that and and not look at you a a their father i i honestly ca understand why you do want to spend more time with them . and irrespective of what happened between between u and and you moving on and and so forth . i just do think that that your child and my child should really suffer in that way . we like them to have a a normal a life a possible and and be able to to be with both of their parent and why you know what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them . it it just very hard . therapist: okay . okay so there a kind of question you understand why this happened etc . right ? so what next thing we do you sit over there and you will be jeff and see what jeff can answer to you a to where he is at . that maybe a little bit difficult but let do a dialogue a if he were he not here anyway . patient: yeah . therapist: so we we be having a dialogue between jeff imaginary jeff and you in the present here and now . okay . and what is what is he saying ? i know they the hurt and frustration a but any appreciation that he still care for these child a a father . patient: i really do have any appreciation for that because the reason the reason that you given that you busy like i busy in my life and i still give our child priority they still take precedence in my life . and i just do think that that that that right therapist: actually what kind of father you should be for the child ? therapist: you should be proactive in wanting to save them . and i would mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are time when when you want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact u and and see if it okay . therapist: sound like a very good idea . good offer you jeff are you prepared to take that off for the kid sake ? it great go your way what what going on here ? the contract happening okay . seems party seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important . that the child . so child will not suffer they will actually benefit from that agreement if you two can really really come to a mutual agreement to what how we going to take care of the child . because the thing no matter how in my view no matter how people live together a a couple separate together the contract life country i still my father to my child a a mother a much a we could only get that anger out frustration out we can come to an agreement a to how we going to work together and even if you do they do live together . we would live for the with the kid they be happy . doe that make sense to you ? patient: yes . this is in a counseling session . and he ha really participated in informing his contract . therapist: but you hear that this happened for you . and you done it . so is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him no matter how he is ? because there now a new realization that the child need that . father and mother . how that for you ? patient: yeah maybe i just need to let him know that and just extend the invitation of having more time out there . yeah . yeah therapist: you good at that . you very good . who watching you working here ? you very good at creating contract and very clear about what you want . and it a question of how you can the two party can get to that agreement together . what do you think ? patient: yeah therapist: great because that this is a rehearsal for what going to happen .",

patient: um so my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper . and she saw like out of some of the thing that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bother her that i smoke . um so she ha been nagging me for like week to come in and talk to you . so i figured i would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it . therapist: so you came into therapy today ? because your girlfriend pressured you ? patient: yeah i mean it just it easier for me like if i come in here and talk to you like that it . i can spend like minute with you compared to ours or her nagging me through the week so therapist: so you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in ? patient: yeah i mean it covered by insurance . it just minute of my time but therapist: and what she would like you to do and this is her goal not yours would be to stop smoking . yeah . tell me what your goal is ? patient: i do really have one . like i do think smoking is that bad . well i mean smoking can be bad but like it doe it never bothered me like i i do know . it like i really do have any goal to come in besides just having herself on you may . therapist: so do you have a goal of quitting smoking ? patient: no not at all . now there i do know . there like so many good thing about smoking . i get one what really got me into it wa i smoke a lot at work because it give me like one on one time with the bos . so like the fact that i can get that time with my bos is make worth it . therapist: can you tell u some of the not so good thing about smoking ? patient: um i it just a it how i meet people . so like if i like i have cigarette on me but like i do have a lighter and that kind of like keep me from finishing off the pack . because i can finish off a pack a day . but if i do have a lighter than like i carry the cigarette around with me . and then if i see other people are smoking i can go and ask for a lighter and that always kind of went away and to get to these group and i just met so many different people from from smoking like therapist: so smoking the way you presenting it there been a positive thing in your life ? patient: yeah i mean like i only do it socially . so that yeah . therapist: are there any negative aspect to smoking ? patient: i mean yeah i mean everyone everyone know smoking is unhealthy . but like i do i do smoke a lot . like i only only smoke from time to time and it mostly just on the weekend . so it like i do know occasionally i go by smoker for the weekend i might have like a cough . maybe i get like a heavy cough on monday tuesday part of me is gone by wednesday . so it not really that big of a deal . therapist: so you do seem like you too worried about the negative aspect ? patient: now . i mean like the obviously is unhealthy . but like one of the thing i trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reason . i think . therapist: so i wan na ask you a question . i want you to give a response between one and a is called scaling and it to do with the importance of stopping smoking . so one would be it not important to and would be it extremely important to you where do you think you put that number ? patient: i do know . maybe like like a two . like it be cool to get rid of the cough on monday but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else i get from smoking . therapist: so not particularly important ? patient: yeah therapist: now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance how confident are you about confidence ? how confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale of one sound one being not confident all and being extremely confident . patient: i could say probably like an eight or nine like i could i could give it up actually i gave it up recently like for like a month and i did even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friend got smoking like i missed that . so i just started off again but i do know if i like if i really wanted to give it up . forget i sure i could therapist: so stopping smoking is not important to you but you fairly confident you could if you decided to quit . so based on kind of where you are in term of it doe seem like you interested in stopping smoking what would be a goal ? how could we spend this time so that it would be productive ? patient: i do know . like i guess it would it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend that like the stuff that i get from smoking and like you you seem you kind of seem like you get it so like i do know maybe figure out way to like explain to her the thing that i get from smoking to like i do know just kind of help her like realize why i do it other than just to kill myself . therapist: so to help her to understand why smoking work for you . patient: yeah . therapist: that that one goal than any other goal you could think of i mean you came in in part because you well that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you . patient: yeah . therapist: so any other relational goal you might want to work on there ? patient: well no we have really been like we been fighting a lot because of the smoking . so i think like maybe figuring out way like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fight in a way like i do ascribe that but like having fight that are productive like that just do always end like with u just like going our separate way or like one of u leaving the house but like i guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doe last for like day . therapist: so productive communication and productive argument patient: right yeah yeah . therapist: so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantage of smoking to your girlfriend . patient: right therapist: she understands how important it is to you patient: yeah . therapist: because it doe seem like it really important to you . but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument and feel like you not at a stalemate ? patient: right yeah yeah i think that be cool . therapist: all right . well you want to make those two goal . we work one so we can spend this time going up too fast . patient: yeah i can do it that it kind of like killing two bird with one stone . therapist: doe that make sense to me . well that what we do . so what i like to do i see you again and about a week . patient: right right . therapist: so if you could reflect on some of these change you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator . because a lot of this revolves around communication . patient: yeah therapist: communicating the advantage of smoking but also communicating in the arguing so that you have productive end to these argument right . so it really more moving from argument to collegial conversation that have a positive result . patient: yeah . yeah that be cool . we can do that . therapist: okay . so if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then next time we meet we talk about those different goal and maybe way to make some small change in that relationship to to meet those goal . patient: right . all right . sound good . therapist: all right . thanks for coming in kylie . patient: thank you .",
            "smoking can be bad but it doe it never bothered me like i do know . i get one what really got me into it wa i smoke a lot at work because it give me like one on one time with the bos . i can finish off a pack a day . because i can finish off a pack a day . because i can finish off a pack a day . but if i do have a lighter than like i carry the cigarette around with me ."

patient: um i think a sense of community and belonging . therapist: okay . patient: i think those two and respect respect . therapist: okay patient: yeah well i think community and belonging i kind of related them . you know i said i wa in the marching band i really you know i really enjoy being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working toward together towards that one goal . and then in term of respect i i kind of view that a one of like my major like role like i really do think respect is important and to respect myself and respect those around me . therapist: okay . patient: i placed great importance to them . therapist: okay great . so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team give you a sense of belonging like you said sort of a sense of purpose . patient: yeah . therapist: and then the respect is really sort of all encompassing not just authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammate or your bandmates and other people around you . patient: yes . therapist: okay that great . all right . well one of the thing i want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friend so what kind of thing do you like to do when you get together with your friend ? patient: um sometimes if you just you know go to the movie go to the beach like i said or sometimes we just get together at someone house play some board game and hang out . therapist: and when you hanging out with friend is there ever alcohol involved . patient: yeah sometimes therapist: okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fit into sort of your social scene ? patient: well it mostly just for for party or party setting is kind of to get thing going and get everything loosened up a they say therapist: mm hmm . and so when you go to party most of the time there alcohol there . patient: yeah therapist: okay . and how often do you think you would say you drinking ? patient: i say i on a not busy month for instance i say about like two weekend out of the month to three . therapist: so about half the time you drinking and half the time you not . patient: yeah therapist: can you tell me what different about the day when you choose to drink versus not to drink ? patient: the day that we drink are mostly like i said they party . so it more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we do it a lot more relaxed . it a lot more hanging out playing board game watching the movie . therapist: so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohol is there . patient: yeah definitely . therapist: okay ? and do you notice a big difference ? or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus the night you playing board game ? patient: i think of them a a different . i think you know night in playing board game and thing it meant to be relaxing . so it nice to have like that kind of breather . versus with a party . it a lot more energetic . it a after at all it very draining . mm hmm . but in the moment it quite fun to dance and have fun . therapist: okay so they sort of pro and con . patient: yes . therapist: okay . what are the thing that you like about drinking or like about alcohol ? patient: um it you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because i guess we not you know everyone drinking together . we a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stress or thing like that . but it can be when it too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad . therapist: okay . so sort of in the too much drinking or at time can you tell me some of the le good thing are not so good thing about alcohol ? patient: a lot of time it make make people stupid . yeah you know people make dumb decision and thing like that we usually try to be a safe about it a possible . so we like sleep over a friend house . and you know we not driving and it mostly within our friend group . so we not worried about stranger putting weird thing in our drink . but um definitely some of the idea people can have when they stupid when they drunk and can be really stupid . therapist: okay so you trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activity . patient: yeah . therapist: you trying to stay put you not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust . but yeah it sound like there still some some thing happening . patient: sometimes yeah . therapist: can you tell me a little bit about that ? patient: well i especially do like it whenever me or one of my friend like we drink too much and we have like throwing up or thing like that . i do . that not fun . therapist: yeah . throwing up is never fun . patient: yeah it not . therapist: and how often do you think that happens ? patient: for me that happened to me once . it wa the first time i ever drank . and it wa it wa a lot . i did know what i wa doing . i wa mixing all kind of weird thing . and just kind of taking anything anyone gave me . that did end well . but after that i have but i do have friend that that still do sometimes . so i end up like having to take care of them or something and it kind of put it down on my on my fun . therapist: uh huh . okay so on the one side some of the fun thing associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree . let loose a little bit more . on the other hand there a little bit more i guess . planning involved because you have to make sure that you doing it safely or a safe a you can . and then there can be some other consequence like throwing up or even if it not you that sometimes you stuck . your fun is sort of ruined when you stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much . okay and the other not so good thing about the alcohol patient: people can get a little sloppy i guess like they all loose like with people and corner doing thing that should be done in private . therapist: that kind of stuff . so you kind of stuck being exposed to thing . patient: yeah got it . therapist: all right . well you mentioned a couple time that you made a few decision to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking . why did you make those decision ? patient: i just i you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic . so i i see like the issue that are involved in i seen movie and thing i know that junk drive is an issue . so i you know i want to be a safe a possible in those term and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like someone house or parent at home or something . but so i like i know that there are danger involved . and i guess i want to limit that and still be able to have fun therapist: okay . it sound kind of similar to your your value of respect to so on the one hand you the drinking maybe help with the belonging community to start . if there too much then it sort of defeat the purpose . patient: right . therapist: and then with the respect one of the thing you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundary not sort of cross line . how do you think that the drinking fit in with that ? patient: in term of what in term of respect ? therapist: yes . patient: i think well in a way i do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because i not putting thing i putting thing and then that should be there . okay . and then but in term of highway i am respecting myself i am i respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone house and like trying to limit my drinking . so i do get to that blacked out like that calling up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior . so i not going to go to some random person i may into i do know where to do . i do know what and thing like that . therapist: okay . so you sort of looking for that balance ? patient: yeah . therapist: how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but not crossover . okay . and what have you come up with at this point ? do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or ? patient: i usually will i start off by making sure that i make my own drink so i know what in it and how much is it so that way i control how much i drink . so i usually just you know get one of those . cup and then make one drink . and then i try to make it last a long a possible . and i be like alright this is my one drink and i good . and that way i still have something in my cup . so people are going to be like oh here have some more like no i good . i have mine . and i still be you know having some to like let loose a little . therapist: and do you feel like that working pretty well for you ? or do you sometimes exceed that limit ? or or what do you think ? patient: for the most part it work pretty well . because like i said people you know if people come asking you trying to pressure me i be like no i good . i have you know i still have some like i get some later and then never end up getting anything . but sometimes they be like hey let take a shot and everyone gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot . and then at that point i be like oh well maybe i can take one more . and that when i start you know falling into too much . therapist: so a portion of the time it working well for you and another portion of the time you maybe you like you like to make some adjustment to make it a little smoother . okay so kind of thinking along those line how important is it to you to make some change or make some adjustment to your drinking to sort of fit with your value and your goal for yourself . patient: i like to make sure that i you know in term of respecting myself my body i like to you know try to drink le okay like a you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but i also like it to be so you know i not damaging my body and i like my liver doe work by the time i like . and you know have my friend on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together a a group a a community . therapist: uh huh . so kind of combined goal . patient: yes therapist: okay . so you you have a goal . it sound like actually cutting back on your drinking . how important is it to you to work on that goal on on a scale of one to where one is not at all important . and is it the most important thing right now . patient: i say about like like a six or seven . oh like to work on it . but you know if i get around to it i get around to if i do i do . hmm . therapist: well why you say six or seven rather than like a four ? patient: um because i still think it it important . uh huh . i still you know like i said i do want my body try especially going to med school like i know how thing affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and thing like that . i know that once i get to college it not it not gon na gon na work out being you know drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam like i know that not that not feasible . it not a good idea . therapist: yeah looking ahead . you ca keep drinking this way and reach the goal that you have for yourself . okay . well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to i think on that same scale from one to patient: i think if i made the decision that i wa going to for sure then i think definitely like a i know i can . therapist: oh wow . okay why do you say ? patient: it just because i know that once i make the decision i know i can do it . uh huh . making the decision in the first place . therapist: okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reason why you would like to cut down . have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that . patient: um i thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friend without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let just stay in today . like let not go out or something . or just be like hey i not like i not gon na drink today . and then even if my friend do like being okay with them drinking around not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and then doing whatever they want . therapist: so sort of trying to plan more activity that do involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activity without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking le than you drinking . okay . doe that sound like a goal you want to work on now or ? patient: i think so i think it it very feasible . i think it possible . therapist: okay . so i guess we talk about le alcohol activity . i just making some note to myself and then maybe reducing the amount of drinking that you doing if alcohol is involved . okay . patient: i think so . that good . therapist: doe that sound like something you like to do ? patient: yash therapist: okay . well i really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sound like you have a lot of really good goal for yourself really ambitious goal and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there . and it sound like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friend who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol . and that you know there a lot of benefit you see both to your body in your health your school performance and even some of the social stuff in term of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequence of drinking too much . patient: yeah therapist: so yeah you know it really sound to me like you have a good plan in place . and a long a you willing and interested in meeting again i be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it going . patient: yeah i like it . therapist: alright great so i plan to see you then in a few more week .",
            "therapist started conversation by the introduction and also got patient into the conversation by asking about patient introduction and hobby also about family and friend partying and all . the patient used to drink and booze sometimes while partying with friend to have fun . sometimes patient friend indulge in some dangerous activity like drink and drive and all . patient doe like his friend behavior when they are drunk . sometimes patient tried to avoid such hazardous activity and realized that he is doing wrong because it is harmful . patient visited therapist because patient think that such activity cost his life . even patient care about his life but he end drinking more without being known . the patient is out towards his goal because even he think it important but he is still so . but the patient confident about his decision which he is going to take in college . patient is going to limit his habit of drinking after going to college . therapist made some note on patient habit so therapist can help patient reach the goal . therapist understand him and explained to him about the benefit he ha got in life like goal supportive friend etc ."

and correct me if i wrong with sound like i using different word than you use . but it sound like when you had that first drink you kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working . patient: yeah that pretty accurate . therapist: that pretty accurate . all right . so taking yourself kind of back to that moment . all right we we had that first . that first drink like you finished that first drank therapist: what wa your what wa your thought at that at that moment ? patient: just like shameful . like i did really really well . and then here i wa . i just finished a drink and i knew i wanted another one . therapist: okay so shameful is kind of like the feeling . but the thought is i did really really well . right ? therapist: so that what your thinking wa . i did really really well . therapist: and what ? wa that the end of the thought or wa that wa there more before you had that next trick ? patient: i guess just i wa doing well . and then i had a drink and i just felt like an awful person . so i figured what wa the hurt having more therapist: sort of sequence would have been you had to drink . you felt shameful . at the same time you thinking that you were doing really well . and then just really a you said before you just felt like a loser . and then you decided might a well just have the second drink . so another thought might be that like i might just have a second drink . patient: yeah therapist: yeah . so you can see others some thought and some feeling at work . right a you finish that first drink wa a fairly quick but those thought feeling fairly . occur fairly quickly after the drink . patient: yeah absolutely . a i wa finishing and then finished therapist: so right away you regret it and that regret a you thought about it therapist: do might a well just just continue drinking now because you kind of blew it . patient: i already messed up i might a well keep going . therapist: okay . therapist: and that a common cycle to fall into . and you had three week we had had a drink prior to that . so let let look at this . let try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit . if you had if you had a friend who wa in the same predicament right you had a history of using alcohol and then at three week without any alcohol use and then their behavior wa to have a drink . what would you think of them ? patient: i think that they had a rough day or something wa to happen where patient: i mean it just wondering therapist: i had a rough day one drink and what would you think of their behavior ? how would you categorize that behavior ? patient: that just they made a mistake . therapist: so not ideal therapist: depending on their point of view maybe a little irresponsible . patient: yeah i think irresponsible therapist: irresponsible but you would necessarily characterize them a a bad person . patient: no . therapist: but their behavior wa a bit of responsible . patient: yeah . therapist: you know in term of like the recovery plan which would be to not drink . therapist: but when you apply that same example examination to your own situation how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink ? patient: it wa my mistake it wa in it . it make me a worse person for doing it . therapist: so you see how you you being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself . like your your evaluation of yourself is is fairly harsh . you mentioned loser earlier and ashamed . therapist: whereas you would necessarily evaluate someone else that way . therapist: how would you evaluate your behavior ? how would you how would you judge your behavior taking that first drink ? patient: shameful . i mean irresponsible which is bad overall . therapist: so so bad irresponsible shameful . therapist: is there a way to separate that behavior in term of in term of your thinking the way you evaluate it from yourself like are you into behavior ? therapist: together a meshed or can you be separated ? patient: i think we could be separated but it it feel like we like i am that behavior therapist: in that moment . it very congruent for you . patient: yes therapist: the shame match the behavior to behavior match shame . like it there one at that moment . mm hmm . but really logically rationally you you ryan your identity and value and your behavior something you do . therapist: but in the moment it hard for you to see that . therapist: mm hmm . looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are ? patient: yeah i mean just because you have one drink doe make you a horrible person and therapist: no certainly not . and you were you were clean for three week and you had one drink . so really your behavior wa a slip . therapist: right it wa and irresponsible in relationship to your goal i suppose . but still a slip . and you could have stopped . but that shame got ahold of you . right . i thought well now i done it . i blew it . yeah . so with that mentality you kind of set yourself up for drinking more . so i think this is important because we seen this cycle like where you have week of sobriety and then we drink a bit and then have week a writing . and i wondering if part of the difficulty you facing is you not coping with the slip a just slip patient: okay . therapist: you allowing them to be gateway into a lot more drinking than the slip . doe that make sense ? that that pretty accurate . therapist: and you see how the shameful feeling kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that really consistent with their goal which would be to not continue drinking . patient: mm hmm . therapist: another piece of this too is the association associating with friend who drink you putting yourself in a treacherous situation . again that a behavior . therapist: right ? that doe make you one way or the other . it a behavior . how would you judge that behavior going out with friend ? patient: i do know . i mean difficult because i like being around those people . but i guess it would be it risky . therapist: risky okay . it a risky behavior . and what doe it make you who are you ? because you do that behavior . like how do you feel about yourself ? when you take that risky behavior patient: guilty therapist: okay therapist: so you have guilt when you go out with your friend . and then you have shame if you drink . and both in this case both emotion that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking . so part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstance like to recognize that a risky behavior which you have . and the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away right . doe that doe that separation of what we do and who we are ? make sense to rationally ? patient: kind of therapist: feel a little unnatural though . patient: yeah . patient: yeah . therapist: so maybe a you confronting therapist: similar situation in the course of the next week you could be aware of behavior that might put you at risk and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior . so so just judge the behavior . okay . right . and do do pas any judgment on yourself . therapist: so that make sense . patient: kind of yeah . therapist: it might help you to . therapist: since it a little tough to because right now the feeling and the judgment retro twined . right . it might help to write down when these thing happen and kind of write down like like one row for this is how i judge this behavior . but i thinking about doing and this is how i judge myself . so if you see a lot of self judgment that might be a clue that you falling into a cycle a little bit patient: okay therapist: where you making decision based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior . patient: okay therapist: that helped a little bit . patient: yeah i think that would probably be beneficial . therapist: so that be our plan going forward . therapist: until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior any judgment you may have about yourself . right and there some insight that can be gained there . right . kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot . patient: okay . therapist: sound like plan ? patient: yeah i think i can try that . therapist: okay good . i see you next week . and we see how you did with those goal . patient: okay",
            "the patient feel they have been in a rut last week . they have gotten a job and have felt like a loser for drinking once . but the patient seems to drink more once they start since they feel like a loser . the patient is scared to go out with friend since there is alcohol . they recall a discussion with therapist saying they feel ashamed when they have the first drink . the patient feel really well but feel awful instantly after the first drink then they continue drinking a such . the patient identifies if someone else drink after a rough day they are a little irresponsible but not a bad person . however the patient call themselves bad irresponsible and shameful for the same . the therapist clarifies to the patient that linking slip to shame make the patient drink more . they act a gateway . the patient feel guilt when meeting friend and see it a risky . the therapist clarifies part of behavioral strategy is to avoid the circumstance like to recognize that a risky behavior . the patient is asked to separate what we do and who we are . the patient is asked to write these thing down this week and make decision based on rational judgement and behavior instead of emotion . the therapist will meet the patient next week ."

            "therapist: all right let how are you ? patient: good good . therapist: it good to see you . yeah . patient: yeah i mean good week with the roommate . i had a good conversation with her about like what time are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving him better head up on when i really mean . therapist: silence . terrific . so what wa what specifically ? i mean i know we talked a lot about that but what specifically did you say to her or how did you bring it up patient: is just telling her that like my study are really important and i understand like it also important that she time with her boyfriend but that i would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are time when like we really need to respect each other space . and yeah she responded really well . yeah she wa like just really give me a good head up before . terrific . you . yeah . and that we kind of decided like certain time are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not therapist: right . right . right . because i think that really similar no we kind of talked about that . because i remember like a few session ago i wa kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in term of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the way that you we talked about that before in term of like you know first starting that oftentimes one of the way that you manage your feeling that you kind of you think you letting people know what you you know feeling but it doe really come out . and i know that it something that you and i had to really like you know kind of work out but sound like that . you were able to talk with her in that she heard you . and a i want a i kind of thought that she wa actually really responsive in a very positive way . patient: so i think being a little way direct wa helpful . therapist: it really nice i think to you been able to do that more with me and i feel like that that i feel like it been really helpful . i know they been kind of pushing you on that . and that been hard but i feel like it been really nice to feel like it really been helpful with your relationship with kathy . so that fantastic . and also you know again i know that i keep you know like saying this over and over again . but you know a you worked on these thing it been really notable that it really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it really you really seen a lot of real nice improvement . so awesome . anything else that you know so you had a really good conversation with kathy anything else go on this week ? yeah i got to spend some time with brooke . patient: at home for two day and it wa with my mom and okay therapist: okay . so she still sixer . did she have a birthday recently ? patient: he awesome . therapist: oh that great . almost seven great . you plan for birthday for her or what are you patient: she really into frozen ? therapist: okay ? like anything frozen . okay okay okay . yes . okay that sound terrific . and so then you spend some time with her . so obviously that wa real positive for you . did you ? when you were there ? did you have any opportunity to you know visit with your mom ? or how did that go ? i patient: i think my mom wa around like we kind of all spent time together . and like she asked about school . they were like tell her a little more about school and how thing are going . yeah we do really get a one on one time . therapist: how doe it feel for you in term of like for her ? i know you talked about not really liking that . she all the sudden is deciding now that she want to really be kind of like you know the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life . but how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how thing have been going for you . i mean patient: i kind of like allowed myself to tell her i guess i do think have been going . i mean like to an extent like it wa like it broke and whatnot like we do really sit down just do together . therapist: so kind of what we had discussed kind of that you been you like you been allowing yourself to be more connected with her but you still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary . yeah . yeah . well i sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that gone on you know with you know kind of the infidelity issue with your dad or at least it just you know kind of like the wondering about that . i mean i think you kind of know that that wa probably what wa going on but then you know and then moving you how harsh and critical she wa issue with brooke you know even i still even remember to for her to have gotten to the point where she would even let you like go to your grandmother funeral or at least you know kind of so all those thing have been so like you know front and center you know and so now i feel like that she made this real dramatic shift and you know wanting to start being a mom that sound like that . you really working to try to manage that in you know in a better way ? patient: yeah . i mean like we still butt head a little bit . i sure shane but therapist: yeah yeah but when you do butt head what is it how what happens in term of your eating when you guy kind of like you feel like that there a little bit of a friction . patient: i mean i guess that like kind of leap back to thing like thing are really good this weekend for the most part and then kind of when i wa leaving she just like either just brought up thing about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what going on at school and if i seeing anyone yeah it just like we do have that relationship . therapist: right . so that really that a really stressful time ? patient: like when i got back to school like right after that . and like caught me . therapist: well it make a lot of sense because again you know like you know we really reviewed this quite a bit but you know historically that how it been you know that that really been a real enemy . it really clarifies why we working on this because it so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patch that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feeling . and that when food like really you know patient: you know all comment though . yeah . what i wearing . right . right . therapist: right . right . yeah . so it really hard to you know i can understand it really hard to let that go . i mean cuz obviously there a lot of lot of feeling that you have about that . yeah . yeah . but on the other hand too it seems like that you know thing have been going really well . how have thing been going in term of just in general like school friendship you know anything else that on the horizon ? patient: yeah kind of scene guy . therapist: i wo get too excited about that . but tell me about him telling you about him . patient: yeah he felt like my mother . therapist: now what this ? you have to at least give me his name ? what his name ? patient: his name alan . therapist: alan . okay . okay . all right . well did you like i not gon na blow this out of proportion . but how ? how did that kind of come about ? patient: yeah cost together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop . yeah . and then just kind of asked to like do a movie night . and i wa like chill and good . nice . ya know like therapist: yeah . nice . nice . that great . oh i really happy . that great . so a lot of really nice thing that are going on . yeah that terrific . yeah . so then for you to go like from you know because you know we kind of got going with this thing . it wa kind of like you were full on binge eating you know virtually every day sometimes twice a day and now it be down to you know three like in the space of like you know just like seven eight week is pretty remarkable . so no i really pleased with how hard you been working cuz you really been pushing yourself . and i really appreciate it . i know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard . it hard for you patient: is like not being able to like i do feel comfortable really telling her yet about . therapist: and you may not you know i mean it like you know another we talked about there like maybe there are time when you just do really want to share some of that stuff . you know and and i think sometimes my experience ha been some parent like you know the goal is not to make her feel bad . if you would want to share it you want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like like oh yeah you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder you know because then that that feel you know that doe feel quite right . and know that that you know i know that you have a lot of hard feeling but i do really feel like that . that how you want that to go you know ? yeah . and i know we talked about it a lot but how are thing going with your dad ? yeah patient: yeah . yeah he doing well hoping that he coming up here to school to see me once he play a couple week . great . therapist: so nice . they be really nice for you to spend time with them . that great . that really great . yeah . so let talk some more about this thing with your mom because i feel like that . i mean i know it tough but i guess i been thinking about this a lot especially after last session that that given the fact that you know you and brooke are so close and it doe feel like that your mom is at least she seems like she making she trying to make an attempt to connect with you . whether or not you know at what point would you feel like that you ? well what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like maybe not let down the wall but kind of soften those a little bit . i mean is there something is there something that like if you could ask they like okay mom if you did this then i would do this . not that you would do that . but just wondering if like what would you ? ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more . patient: i mean like i wish she really recognized like kind of the pressure that she put on me back in the day huh ? yeah and just like now to just know just kind of be there in the moment . so like trying so hard to like thing still come out . like she still make her little comment that they . therapist: yeah i know . we talked about this but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could ? like even let her know that . that that put a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she make kind of hurt your feeling because i know that in the moment you feel it . but what would it be like for you if you were to just like yeah say like you know i know that you i know that you mean well i mean maybe she doe but maybe it sometimes important to approach it that way but it really hurt my feeling or you know i feel like that that really put a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way . and you know patient: so i mean i am seeing that i like starting to see that she doe mean well . therapist: right because i know that you did that . you done that with your roommate . i know there been other time when people have done that . so i know that that been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know thinking about that relationship with your mom because it doe seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jab here she send something out and and and the way that you take it in is more like harsh critical . you know her and and i just do know like color . it kinda like with kathy . when you talk with her how it like it wa like it wa like oh of course like you know uh you know i try to be more sensitive and i not really sure . you know whether or not your mom would be . patient: yeah i mean i guess she could do . yes i worry that because we always been kind of defensive towards each other . i just worry that like that will happen again . i mean i do know like it might not because of thing happen . right . but therapist: yeah yeah . yeah . well i think there are time when i wonder if like maybe if there a time when you say something like i know there have been time when you kind of snap back at her you know or you kind of like you know barber or kind of jabber a little bit . what if you know again you what have you thought about like because it sound like that you really aware when you do that ? because you know that when she say something you have a tendency to jet back . you could just say you know you know i realized i wa i that wa a that wa a jab at you . and i really sorry i aware that that sometimes i kind of get really critical with you and i that doe i do feel very good about that . now i wonder how she would you know if if that would what that would do maybe maybe it would do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable but you think about it i mean and you kind of mull that over in your mind about what that might be like because my experience ha been that sometimes . you know i hate the phrase be a bigger person because then you know i did want that to come across that way . but sometimes in order to change relationship somebody ha to be willing to kind of like kind of be willing to do something just a little different . and since it seems like you have a growing awareness of you know the interaction that you have with her i wonder if that might be worthwhile . yeah yeah . yeah . mulling over and think about it and and we keep talking about it . but yeah sound like it wa a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pay off because again the more you done that we seen real positive impact on your eating so nice",

patient: well i just thought with sleeping tablet i thought they might help . therapist: would it be a good idea perhaps if we think about all the option available to you and then decide which which one may be best for you patient: okay . are there any other option therapist: we might have heard of some of the talking therapy being able to sit down and talk with u sort of a trained counselor about about your feeling and about what been happening . patient: well that will hekp my sleep . well let me be able to cope the next day to sleep . therapist: it may help you deal with some of your feeling . i take on board about the thought about using a sleeping tablet . i think that could be another option . obviously when the concern we have is that we do want to have you on sleeping tablet for a long period of time because their issue about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them . we can use them for a short period of time say for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep . patient: yeah . that sound good to me . therapist: what about those the two option a option the counselor or perhaps sleeping pill ? patient: counseling chair counseling i like i mean i just feel if i had some sleeping tablet i might just just give me a spare really and i quite happy with the counseling a well . therapist: okay so you like to try both . i think that that sound a good idea . would you be happy to the counselor here at surgery ? patient: yes . that fine therapist: okay so i can organize that i can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment . it also be really helpful for me a well if you could complete one of our head questionnaire . patient: most question perhaps question . therapist: sorry . it a short questionnaire just asking some question about your feeling and it help me to find out . if there any more help i can give you an annex see if that okay . from what you told me today i mean it sound really for the last month or so you felt really low . since split from you your husband . patient: yeah . therapist: your sleep not being good . your appetite is not being good . patient: i am mess therapist: is sound to me . self esteem taking a real not because i certainly think the help we can give you with some count in which we have a counselor that come here in the surgery that will be it be a benefit to you . and then we try the short course of sleep tablet to try and get you back into a state sleep pattern . patient: okay therapist: maybe i can see you in about two three week time . and i do want you to think that you have to sort of manage all this by yourself . i mean that why we here . we here to to help and support you . patient: yeah . okay . therapist: let me do the prescription then . patient: thank you therapist: so that gone to reception a you can catch up on the way out . patient: okay . therapist: and i give you one of the head question a well . patient: okay . therapist: complete that before we see you next time . patient: okay . thank you doctor . thank you for seeing me therapist: okay see you next time . patient: thank you . therapist: okay bye bye .",

patient: no no it wa the it wa a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this disappointment for this extra scan . therapist: and did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra ? patient: no they did actually i mean i try to ask you always do and play sweet talk lady but she wa not pretending . therapist: okay . and i do have any thought yourself or any worry about why they were calling back ? patient: i guess it wa gallstone . therapist: so just tell me a little bit about what symptom you been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there some scuff on it . patient: right . therapist: i just like to make sure that i know what been happening to you first of all and then we go into detail patient: all started a few month ago ray with his tummy pain . therapist: yeah . patient: and then i saw your colleague and he said we better get a scan . yeah i went for that scan . it wa only about two week ago . and i got literally four or five day later . got the phone call ? i needed this additional scan . so i went on monday . therapist: okay . okay . and so do you still have pain at the abdomen ? patient: yes . yeah it just there all the time . therapist: okay . well a i said you scan result ha come through to me today . patient: yes therapist: i afraid i afraid there is something that potentially a little bit worrying on it . patient: really ? therapist: yeah . patient: so what what the worrying thing that you found ? therapist: well if i take you back to the first scan first . so what it appears that that showed is that there wa something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland patient: suspicious ? therapist: yeah . so there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen which is quite closely evolved right and called the pancreas . and when they did the ultrasound scan which is a good scan but is particularly detailed right there wa something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info patient: all right . therapist: so that why they called you back for the second scan patient: that doe sound good doe they ? therapist: which wa a ct scan which is a detail that we likely to be talking about . patient: right . therapist: so the second scan i showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas . patient: really ? therapist: when i say something what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer patient: god . i did expect that . god i am only cancer . therapist: i really sorry to have to break it to you like this but i felt that it wa important that a soon a i knew that i communicated that to you . so i mean i know that i just dropped a big bombshell on you . patient: oh yes . god therapist: have you got any any question in a minute ? have you got anything that you can query ? patient: what the pancreas and i have got cancer . what can i can make can they cut it out ? therapist: and it depends . and basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen a i said and it control some of the sort of the hormone the fluid that your body prefers the body . because it at the back of the abdomen often we do know very much about it until it start causing a bit of a problem like your pain that you been getting . so that probably explains why you not had many other symptom . patient: right therapist: and the answer is i do know what could be done about it . but we need to ask a specialist what we usually do . this situation is asked especially today to see what ha happened think about what wa cooking . right ? do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is patient: okay . okay . therapist: so i understand that i just thrown a whole lot of information at you and patient: i just ha expected that so . therapist: i mean is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them ? oh quit i went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you had a bit . bit more time . patient: i suppose i could love myself . no doubt come by myself actually . yeah okay . it will just be easier . feel sure . therapist: i mean i think it important to say that we do know for definite what this is . we have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right . so we do everything very quickly . yeah try and get some answer . right . but we do know any definite nothing certain in a minute . but i do appreciate that . i just given you a little bit of time . so my door is open and yes . okay . have you got any question ? patient: no . therapist: i taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer if that what it is . patient: okay therapist: some of it a little bit a little bit scary . and a i said we do know nothing certain yet . i wonder if you might want to come back to see me . so what this doe is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right ? patient: okay . therapist: and it talk about cancer in general . the type of way in which you can affect the pancreas patient: okay . okay . therapist: how we do it and how we work out what we do about it talk about the different type of scan that you had and this one is ct . patient: yes . okay . therapist: and then depending on what they find yeah it give you a brief run through of the different type of treatment . patient: okay therapist: did you want to have a read through this and then maybe tomorrow . patient: yeah we like tomorrow . yeah . okay . i like this . therapist: i see you tomorrow .",

patient: yeah i think it would actually i can recite that . therapist: yeah internally a you because it not long . patient: i think i could it will be easy to remember . and i could just like maybe put it down on one of my note card in front of me or something . therapist: and how much do you believe that those statement are true ? patient: i think you know sitting now sitting here now i believe them in the moment sometimes it a little hard to believe because i convinced myself otherwise . but i think i actually believe that that that that true . they deserve to be in the program . therapist: okay so there those self talk item . you believe them to be true . yeah but you recognize in the moment and i want you to be aware of this . you might not believe them a much right ? but remember that you know we worked on them . right ? you came up with them . patient: yeah . therapist: and you believe them now . right ? so try to keep that in your mind a you start to doubt yourself . patient: yeah . it easy . i realize it easy to form these plan . right . therapist: then the chaos of anxiety in the word is harder . so the more task you can make concrete and you can write down and you can rehearse i think the better off you be . okay . i would like to see you your presentation next friday . yeah i would like to see you right before that . so be about a week . okay for that . do you have any question ?

            "therapist: hey lewis how you doing today ? patient: i am okay how are you ? therapist: i doing well . thanks for asking . how thing been going ? patient: they been alright . therapist: last time we were talking . it sound like you still having some difficulty with the quiz . mm hmm . is that still the case ? patient: yeah it still . it still panic when i take them . they still panic . therapist: can you tell me about the process of taking the quiz ? i know we tested on a little bit before . patient: okay . so i going to class i fine . i sit down to take the test . i fine . the test is in front of me question one . i not going to get that answer . therapist: so you looking down so you take these quiz in class ? patient: yes . therapist: like a paper pencil ? patient: hmm hmm therapist: okay with other student around you . patient: yeah . therapist: alright is the is having other student around distracting you ? patient: no what ha happened in previous online class is the same . therapist: so it you pretty sure it the quiz itself and not some external . patient: hmm yeah . therapist: okay . so it wa paper and pencil you seated in the room . room relatively distraction free . patient: yeah yeah everybody quiet . therapist: and you looking down at really the first item on the on the quiz and what happening ? what happening that a you look down you read that first item . what happening at a thought we start a thought level what happening ? what are you thinking ? patient: i thinking i reading the question and i thinking oh my god there okay there four . okay ? so it got to be it got to be one of them . and i am not going to pick the right one . i gon na think i pick the right one and it going to be the one that the second choice and i am not going to pick the right one . therapist: okay so your thought is that you going gon na get you gon na select the wrong response and therefore get that quiz item . wrong . patient: yeah . therapist: how about behavior ? like do you notice anything physically going on ? a you thinking about that quiz item and how you going to get you call patient: to my palm are probably sweaty like i probably a little tense . therapist: a little tense ? patient: yeah . that really is . therapist: so it could be is that this thought of i going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feeling the physical feeling . all right . so what happens when you answer item one like you do know if you have a right or wrong immediately right because it a paper and pencil . so you answer item one and you move on to item two . what happens then ? patient: start all over again . i already like well i already got the first one wrong and now my i chance are higher getting this one wrong . therapist: so if you like it because you because you thought that you got the first one wrong . that your chance again a cycle on one wrong actually increase . patient: yeah . therapist: okay . patient: if i get one to one wrong the whole test gon na to be wrong . therapist: have you ever had a quiz that you taken where you were confident that you got the first item right ? patient: i sure i have i ca remember any . therapist: but eventually you going to come to one item that your doubt about ? patient: yes therapist: right . patient: inevitably it happens . therapist: there gon na be one that maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you . so it seems like what you saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought from from that point on the next item is is more difficult because you having a similar thought doe that pattern continue ? patient: throughout test ? yes . therapist: so explain to me what like let just go with the example the first item like because just just to keep it more simple . so you have the first item . and that did work out for that thought right ? the second one your thought wa i have even greater chance of missing . so what happens after you respond to that second item ? patient: it just compound i just start i feel worse than worse a the quiz a i continue . therapist: that awful . so it an awful feeling for me . patient: yeah right . therapist: so by the time you get to item five or six ? patient: i convinced i it over . i gotten to zero if it yeah if is the first i gotten to zero i gotten a bad grade . therapist: right . so that what on your mind . patient: uhh hmmm mm therapist: and how are those physical symptom ? are they the same different or new symptom ? patient: if it like if it if it like start early at the beginning of the test ? to my heart like pounding at this point but i still have a sweaty palm . i still like tensing . therapist: so it really just get mentally and physically more unpleasant for you . patient: mm hmm . yeah . therapist: so when you just when you saying panic the panic really occurring a few item in after you have the first one that you thought you missed . patient: mm hmm . therapist: and this ha been happening for a while a you described right ? patient: yeah . therapist: well how about your grade ? how have you actually been doing on the quiz ? patient: i been a pretty solid b student . therapist: umm hmm . patient: so and i feel i wish i did better . i wish i got a but i mean these are fine . but when i take this because it not it doe . i do know how it translates . therapist: about your study habit if you consider yourself effective and studying ? patient: i tried i taken workshop on studying i i i think i pretty effective at studying i found what doe work . so i try to study by reading the chapter is taking outline reviewing flashcard which ha i think the best result but therapist: okay so your study habit are good . and your quiz score are good . but you still having these distressing thought and these uncomfortable physical sensation when you take the quiz ? patient: yeah . therapist: is that about right ? patient: yeah that absolutely right . therapist: so really you do necessarily need your performance to change . you just you just need to your thought and feeling and behavior to change . yeah . so how you how you reacting to the quiz maybe . patient: yeah cuz i get b like i said so yeah . therapist: and b is good . patient: yeah . therapist: so alright so i want to take you back to the moment when you looking at the first slide . let go back to that for a second . okay . so you taking a quiz . and you having those thought surrounding the first item which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy . go on mac thought is that i i not going to get this one right . patient: yeah therapist: or something to that effect ? patient: right . therapist: what doe that mean to you ? patient: it mean once i do get that right i not getting in anything else right okay therapist: alright so with that thought mean to you is that you going to miss that item and then you going to miss all the rest of it . so you you going to fail the whole quick whole thing . patient: yeah . therapist: so looking at that almost let call that an intermediate belief right ? it more of a rule or an expectation right ? what doe that mean to you ? patient: it just get worse . if i fail the quiz then i like oh my god i gon na fail the panel i am going to fail the course and that gon na affect my gpa . therapist: so just keep stacking other other belief . so you gon na fail the course . and we gon na fail the final rather than then the course . so a few failed the course . what doe that mean to you ? patient: not going to graduate . therapist: you not going to graduate ? patient: yeah . therapist: so we moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning right ? to fail on the final to fail on the course and now to not graduating . so if you did graduate what would that mean to you ? patient: i ca i ca be a teacher . i ca do what i want to do . therapist: so your chosen location to be a teacher would be not possible . patient: right . therapist: right . so we go a step further and say what would it mean to you if you could be a teacher ? patient: i do know who i be at that point . that what i always saw a my career . so i do know what my future would look like at that point . without that . therapist: so if you were to phrase it and kind of think back a we to the cbt technique and the kind of conceptualization uncovered . if you to phrase a an if statement . what would you ? what would you be if you could be a teacher ? what that make you ? patient: i am a person who did make it . i a person that failed . like we said earlier . therapist: i a person who did make it . i a person who failed . so in a way you saying i a failure . patient: hmm . therapist: right . patient: yeah . therapist: is that close ? patient: yeah it fine . therapist: so remember we talked before about core belief and how these core belief drive these intermediate belief which combined with situation like in your case taking quiz to form these automatic thought . patient: yeah . therapist: so one of your core belief may be that that you a failure . you may believe that . patient: okay therapist: doe that seem like something that you said to yourself before or thought before ? patient: and think about it like that until we did the step up to it now but i i can relate to that . therapist: mmm hmm patient: because a lot of time i do feel like oh i not gon na be able to do this . because it me i wo be able to do it . therapist: not because it challenging or difficult but something to do with you . patient: hmm yeeah . therapist: right . so that what i call like the you personalizing ? patient: right therapist: so you saying to yourself at a variety of level . i going to be unsuccessful ? i going to . . . . doe that make sense . patient: yeah . therapist: do you think that what happening ? patient: it must be because like i said i study i got good grade . i been tested year ago i do have adhd anything intrinsic that would prohibit me therapist: so you able to focus and calm . patient: yeah therapist: well patient: yes i can do all of that . but when it come to it i like i ca do it . therapist: so somewhere somewhere is this dis core belief ? and it possible that it ha something to do with you believing that you are a failure . unsuccessful ? patient: i do think they would see the connection . i think it would be like well you do well in school i do understand . therapist: so they would believe that you a failure ? patient: no therapist: you may believe it ? patient: yeah . i guess yeah . therapist: and similarly if you had a classmate that wa in the same situation and and you know struggled with these disturbing thought and feeling and behavior during quiz how would you evaluate them ? patient: i guess i say the same thing that my family would say like you gon na look at the evidence you not a failure . therapist: and you evaluate that they were a failure . patient: right . therapist: but if it wa yourself . you being a little more harsh . patient: yeah . therapist: which is uncommon . patient: okay therapist: so there a few level at which i think we can go after this . what i call a problem but really it a series of thought and belief . okay . the first is that the comic at the ground level and that when you are taking the quiz . and you have that automatic thought that say i going to miss this item . patient: i not going to get it right . therapist: yes i not gon na get it right . so that your thought i not going to get it right . patient: ahmm hmm therapist: and these situation i like to encourage client to apply what called an adaptive response or self talk . so it a it a noun . if you in a quiz in a quiet classroom it would literally be self taught . patient: right right . therapist: but it a thought that you were consciously applying . so the other thought that automatic patient: right therapist: that just pop in your head right . patient: okay . therapist: this one would be one that you deliberately think patient: and make myself . therapist: so what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you having that you gon na get that item wrong ? patient: i guess that in my past quiz like chance are i i have a good chance of getting it right . therapist: okay so just looking at the probability based on your past performance even though i thinking i going to get it wrong patient: right . therapist: chance are i going to get it wrong patient: right . somehow i still have a b so . therapist: so you are getting most of them . right . patient: right . so i have a good chance . therapist: so i like that adaptive response . right . do you think that make sense for you ? patient: yeah therapist: i think you did well there . so the next time you taking a quiz i want you to apply that adaptiv response . patient: okay therapist: that this take work . right . so this automatic thought gon na come upon you . and then before you know it you gon na have that feeling . patient: yeah right . therapist: physical symptom . patient: yeah . therapist: discus the sweaty palm . right . and the feeling of i think you mentioned patient: yeah yeah . therapist: so do let it discourage you those symptom come on so quickly . patient: okay . therapist: right . there is an intervening thought and you identified it . right . so you will have an opportunity most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point . but the first few time it might be a little rough . patient: yeah testing qa . therapist: i guess the nice thing about a quiz is i mean how many item are on these quiz ? therapist: so you have a few different chance to apply the adaptive response . right patient: right . it more than one . therapist: yeah . so you know you like to get on the first time where you have that on i thought we identified on that thought but if you do no big deal . right ? so you know later on maybe it take them two or three . and then you might remember hey i have this patient: yeah . oh wait supposed to be thinking that . therapist: yeah . and my hope is that a you apply this adaptive response more and more you can reduce the probability that that automatic thought going to come in . patient: yeah therapist: so that one level that i want you to to go after it . doe that make sense ? patient: it doe . i think i can do that . therapist: that how many feel like you could you could do at the other level i guess you call this a deeper level but it all really you know in your brain right ? it just this core belief . patient: right . therapist: okay . and why use the word deeper is because we think of core belief a more stubborn but they do change a easily . patient: right therapist: a automatic thought might . i like you to and this is really just more selection reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that support and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you a failure . patient: okay therapist: right . i think cognitively you kind of understand that you not . right . but another sense you feel like you are right . patient: right . therapist: so in a way cognitively you patient: there that discrepancy . therapist: right . right . there there a little bit of both . patient: mm hmm . yeah therapist: you can tell me that your family would say that not the case . but you still patient: right on paper technically i would . i not . but i still i guess feel that way . therapist: there a part of you that still feel that way . there a part of you that still belief that cognitively . there also a part of you that think through that say that that not accurate . patient: right . therapist: so i want you to weigh the validity of that core belief . patient: okay therapist: right . and actually i think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it . right . and that certainly something to note . but also and this is really more important evidence that refutes it . evidence that run counter patient: right therapist: but record both and we meet next time and we look at the evidence evaluated . patient: yeah we can do that . therapist: so those two those two step you feel like you comfortable with and they make sense to you . patient: yeah they do . yeah i definitely think i can do those . therapist: when the next time you be taking a quiz ? patient: think next week therapist: next week ? patient: yeah therapist: okay i know how these quiz oftehn ? patient: yeah . therapist: all right . so we set up a session for next week . let try to get towards after your next quiz . patient: okay therapist: so we have that to talk about . i think that the next area to make . it sound like the next area . it be good to try and make progress . patient: yeah . therapist: seems like that what you want to work on . patient: yeah . therapist: so we go from there . so i set up an appointment for just to have that quiz . tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence . quickly . patient: yes therapist: doe that sound good ? patient: yes i can do that . therapist: all right . i will set the appointment up and i appreciate you coming in and working through this . patient: yeah . thank you so much .",
            "patient had some difficulty with quiz . patient get panic . patient is fine until the test start suddenly do get the answer . therapist want to know what happens to the patient when he look down at the item . while taking a quiz patient feel like even patient think right answer end up giving wrong answer . patient think that he is gon na get the wrong answer always . therapist want to know about physcal change in body . patient palm get sweary and feel little tense . patient had this feeling for all the question . patient think that he get all quiz wrong . therapist asks about any quiz which patient is confident with answer . patient do remember any . therapist explains about the pattern that patient had . if patient get one wrong he feel that it compound and feel worse throughout the quiz . when patient move to five or six he think it all over . patient getting b grade on quiz and feel fine . therapist asked about study habit and that were goodand score also good but patient still having a uncomfortble physicle sensation in quiz . therapist tell patient have to change his thought and feeling and behaviour . therapist applies cognitive behavioural therapy in which patient will have those thought surrounding first them which will not mistaken the automatic thought talked about this right . patient still feel like that he will get all wrong . with that thought patient is going to miss all the item so patient fails whole thing . therapist call it an intermediate belief it more of rule and expectation . patient think it get worse patient fail the quiz and gon na fail the course and not gon na graduate . patient ca complete the graduation and patient ca be a teacher . therapist want to know what happens if patient ca be a teacher . patient feel a the person who could make and failed . therapist talked about core belief and want to know how the core belief drive these intermediate belief in patient . patient core belief is failure and some other belief like unsuccessful . patient understand the therapist and ready to focus and calm but also when it come patient ca do it . therapist tell that patient is calling himself a failure and unsuccessful . therapist explains how the thought of patient made to miss the item . therapist like to apply self talk to the patient . therapist asks to apply adaptive response next time and tell not to discourage with those symptom . therapist explains how to apply adaptive response in different way ."

            "therapist: so good to see you again . last week we talking about anxiety . do you have your diary card ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay let look at it real quick . bring it over here . patient: yeah therapist: okay so anxiety is really high . what happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary patient: anxiety is always really high . but yesterday wa the worst . therapist: why ? patient: we were driving . my dad wa driving and i wa in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that you know that already make me nervous . i like to be on time . therapist: i know patient: i do want to be late because then what if i get in trouble . so it already kind of on edge . and then we passed the accident that i guess wa causing off the traffic . and there were two car and they were like mashed together like accordion and there wa a tarp . and i know that under that tarp there wa a dead body and the car went right . by it . therapist: that scary . patient: this horrible therapist: kind of explains that number . hmm ? patient: yeah . who would be anxious ? that like a normal thing because there a dead body . therapist: well i be anxious of course . and it kind of scary to see that . and what else did you think when you saw that ? patient: who would drive when there two car mash together like accordion on a dead body ? that insane . you have to be insane to drive . therapist: and your family want you to learn to drive this year because you patient: they insane . therapist: and yet you all you you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere . and if you had a car you could like go see friend more and get out of your lame old town and get to go do fun thing . patient: i ca see my friend anymore if i dead . therapist: true . that true . and i wo get to see you anymore . because you dead . you know i do treat dead people right . remember that ? yeah okay . so on one hand i know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming . and i know you anxious like all the time . patient: and i get that i have to drive because you right . it like the middle of nowhere . and i ca just like not go place but therapist: so i wondering if we can bring it back to some of those thing you talking about to help reduce your anxiety . maybe that one idea to help you be able to get in the driver seat . what do you think ? so essentially you practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver seat of your anxiety a opposed to being a passenger and you letting anxiety outside really your life ? because that what you doing . what do you think ? patient: there a lot of pun jen . therapist: i punning ai i ? so here an idea . let get on board . we start treating this anxiety . we do it really really good . job at it we work hard . and idea driving might not be quite a scary . and let face it being anxious driver increase your risk accident . patient: well that helpful . thanks . therapist: so reducing your anxiety it gon na make you a safer driver . patient: yeah but all these thing you keep telling me that i have to do to be le anxious . they involve like feeling really anxious . therapist: true . patient: there no way to like ca you supposed to like just make it go away . you not supposed to make it worse to make it better . therapist: so here what interesting . you really good at being really anxious . so you be really good at this . and it will go away . i promise you i totally promise you . patient: that soo hard . therapist: you know done well i the expert here of treating anxiety and i promise you it will get better . i know everything . i know this . what do you think ? patient: i think it sound really hard . it really hard . therapist: all i do is totally totally hard . patient: maybe it just not there . same thing that you have to be more anxious to be le anxious . therapist: i know . it is . it pretty insane is it ? i agree . well another option is you could just be anxious the rest of your life . do they have a bus where you live ? patient: no you know that therapist: live with your parent for the rest of your life . i know i forgot . so you can live with your parent for the rest of your life . because you too anxious to leave town you wo be able to drive . so you could just live with your parent be anxious all the time and you could go home so idea on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life . you wo need to learn to drive . i mean your parent are fairly nice . they probably drive around for the rest of your life you know until they pas away or something . in the meantime what about that ? so forget the whole treatment . i pushing you too hard . why do we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety ? you good at it . patient: jenna thats not funny . therapist: it not meant to be funny . what do you think ? patient: that horrible therapist: i really want to help you . i know being anxious every time really hard . so one of the option is to really become good at being anxious and do okay and learn to sit with your anxiety . and another option is yeah getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety . patient: so you saying that no matter what i choose it going to involve feeling anxious . therapist: yeah . for your practice at it . patient: well i mean if those are the only option might a well do the one that gon na make it eventually go away rather than just be there forever . therapist: all right . do you want to review what some of the treatment strategy will be ? patient: yeah i guess . therapist: okay let do that .",

patient: um no not really . like i said i do drink that much . so i would be able to tell you . therapist: okay . and i mean not so good thing about alcohol ? patient: um definitely . yeah . i mean when i at party and stuff and it getting a little later some people that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or they really loud and obnoxious . and that not fun for anybody . therapist: so you seen a lot of other kid yeah had some consequence and decided that not for you . patient: yeah therapist: i got it . i can understand that . any other thing that you can think of ?

patient: um i know it definitely risky . i mean i guess we still do it . therapist: so it kind of something that it just there . patient: yeah it just there . therapist: okay . and i curious you mentioned you know your friend are important to you and your family important in sort of fitting in is important to you and how doe alcohol play a role with that ? patient: um well definitely not in my family life because my parent do really condone okay alcohol use . but friendship i mean when i hanging out with my friend or we at a party or something there usually alcohol involved . therapist: okay . so from your family perspective that drinking is not something that fit very well . patient: yeah . therapist: and with friend you feel like it easier to to hang out with alcohol . or maybe you would have a much fun or your friend would like you a much . patient: i guess it mean this is just there . therapist: okay patient: so it tie in with the whole belonging . therapist: well when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five year or year how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life ? patient: it probably will have a very small role if any in my life considering i have big plan for my future . therapist: okay . can you expand on that a little bit more ? what do you mean ? patient: i mean i do think i would be you know drinking a much or going to party a much if i studying for school or in college or trying to get off school thing like that . therapist: okay so the alcohol something that might make it harder to reach your goal ? patient: yeah definitely . therapist: so when you sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college ? patient: maybe le than i am now . i mean i do drink much anyway . so maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon . therapist: okay so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually . patient: yeah definately therapist: how might that go ? patient: well i mean i guess right now i would try to stop in high school . and once i get older maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything bigger . therapist: yeah . so you do feel the need to make any major change but you feel like you could make some adjustment ? patient: yeah definately that a good thing . therapist: okay . how important is it to you to make some adjustment to your drinking on a scale of to where one is not at all important not something you thinking about . and is the most important thing patient: maybe five or six . therapist: and why did you say five or six rather than like two or three ? patient: because it not something i do not care about it all but it not something that just constantly on my mind that i want to change about myself . therapist: okay . so it is something you have thought about . patient: yeah . therapist: and how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale ? patient: i pretty confident that i can considering that i not really an alcohol user per se . i not really into that whole scene so it gon na be difficult for me . therapist: so what number do you think you say ? patient: on a scale of one to if i can quit alchohol ? therapist: yeah patient: maybe like an eight or nine . therapist: okay . all right . well kind of keeping that in mind . it sound like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustment and you drinking at some point . patient: yes . therapist: and it moderately important to you . it something you would like to do because you have these big goal for yourself . and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful . with it what sort of gold do you think might be good to set for today ? patient: um probably to stop . maybe next friday i go to i have a drink at all . therapist: okay . do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely ? patient: yeah i mean i can just tell my friend my parent my friend are really that pressuring . it just like outside people that do really know that well . so i could just tell them hey i do feel like having a drink today . therapist: but what might be some benefit of following through with that goal ? patient: definitely i have like all my sens there and i be aware of everything that going on . therapist: uh huh . anything else ? patient: um health concern ? i guess i know alcohol is bad for your health . so that would be one . therapist: okay . so it it sound like you actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore at least at the next party and seeing how it go . patient: yeah . therapist: okay . do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it go and see if working out for you . patient: yeah that would be okay . therapist: all right great . and then it sound like some of the benefit you expecting are health benefit and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goal and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequence that your peer do . patient: right . therapist: okay . well very good . is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know ? patient: how would you advise me to like get maybe my friend to stop drinking ? therapist: oh that a great question . so a lot of time kid who are trying to cut back it harder if their friend are still drinking . and one of the easiest thing is trying to have more activity that do involve alcohol . but of course that harder if you not doing planning . so some of the thing that can be useful if you at a party say and there already alcohol there and there are other kid that maybe are your closest friend . some of the thing that i would recommend since you interested are you know carrying around different drink that look like it ha alcohol in it . so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just having the coke say without any alcohol mixed into it . often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something . it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there . do you think any of those thing might work for you ? patient: yeah for sure . therapist: okay . what about in term of talking to your friend about it ? have you thought about how you might approach with them ? or is that something else you like some tip about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking ? patient: i wa just planning on playing them that i do really want to drink anymore . that wa me . know therapist: your friend would be pretty comfortable with that . patient: yeah i mean that wa my closest friend for sure . therapist: okay great . any other concern or question ? anything else ? i go ? patient: no i think okay . therapist: okay . so then like i said i try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few week and see how it going . and then if thing are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling block and we can maybe problem solve together . patient: okay . therapist: is that okay ? patient: yeah . therapist: all right . thanks so much . patient: no problem",

so the internal critic on the side of settling down getting married . and then when you ready to have the critic respond you switch that chair and respond to the emotional need driven and wanting some make sense . okay . so whenever you ready go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic . patient: i want to finish what i doing and i want to finish what i started . i worked so hard on my career path and i so close to finishing . and i want to finish for me want to accomplish those goal that i set for myself ? and something i passionate about ? therapist: so you made your statement . are you ready to switch ? okay good switch . so i use the internal critic . patient: there always time to pursue a career but i need to focus on what expected of me at this time on the best age for having kid i have a loving boyfriend who is ready and want to get married and settle down . and you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time therapist: an internal critic cue in the emotional side in this case the career side been selfish . and notice your posture is very linear and you upright . i noticed you kind of put your hand down a little bit when you talking . try to think of the internal critic body movement . try to act that out a little bit . okay . patient: think it accusation . you know i think i like i just wanted to like tell the emotional part that it being stupid that it you know you you you not acting in the best interest of everyone else . jump at it . therapist: you gon na jump at the emotional side ? patient: yeah . therapist: so that the internal critic they respond back to the term critic from the emotional side . patient: yeah therapist: okay . so the internal critic is just called a selfish and one of the thing is a response . patient: i feel like i being attacked . and i do think it wrong to think about myself and what i am truly passionate about . therapist: let me interrupt you . so your hand are pointing back toward the career emotional self . what can you do with your hand that really embody that you want to communicate to the internal critic ? is there anything else you want to do ? patient: the pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critic is saying . i just want to like push that back towards critic . therapist: so continueand have used that motion there . you you pushing the internal critic away . okay . patient: so i do need i do need to feel guilty you know i do need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dream therapist: doe the internal critic have something to say back ?

it an internal critic le angry le assertive patient: le pushy le pushy le pushy . yeah it not . not a critical . truthfully it just i feel like the the pressure is annoying dwayne on either either shoulder therapist: so the critic is more separated now maybe a little bit but also ha a different outlook . patient: more quiet . it not like always yelling at me . because i think it i mean sometimes it might still say something but not in like the urgency that it had before . therapist: so the critic ha lost some of it vigor and determination . patient: yeah therapist: to move back to the emotional ? patient: i feel calmer . i feel like you know the critic is ha always been a part of me . but that part of me it more like you know it it not a assertive . it not a you know intense right now it a call . and i think that the emotional part of me wa able to win the argument per se you know just because that you know what i want . therapist: so at the end of this conflict after we split into two part here they have this conflict is eventually a decision is a decision to pursue a career or settle down . do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision ? patient: yeah . because i feel like i you know i can stay on my decision is in ha you know ha been to stay on my career path but now i feel le guilty for doing it . therapist: so that that really been your decision all along . but the internal critic wa harassing you this whole time ? patient: yes . therapist: and today you able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little . and allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you made . patient: yeah that i very much therapist: do you feel is helpful technique ? patient: yeah i do . i you know i think that separating the two side helped me realize which one felt stronger . therapist: so he wa able to give you some clarity . patient: yes . therapist: right . all right . well let once reflect on what happened here between now and the next session okay bye guy . kind of a lot happened . and it seems like you gained clarity for your decision . and then we pick up with the next session and see how thing have progressed with . see if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stay back . and if you have more peace with a decision that not like a plan .",
