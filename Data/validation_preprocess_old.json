focus so i cant focus on like what i need to do because i feel like my mind on lot of different things i cant focus on you know exactly what i should be doing its just like im worried about you know all different aspects \\s therapist: alright so your ability to concentrate do hard work of preparing affected \\s patient: yeah its like focus my energy on right things im just like wasting time worrying \\s therapist: alright so this excessive worrying all this interfering of preparing all this goes on right up until youre getting ready to present \\s patient: yeah then like while im presenting \\s therapist: so lets talk about that lets go into actual day present so we have successive work coming in its interfering with your ability but its distressing for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: now these presentations are in class \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so its youre in youre in classroom do you write only one to present in that classroom it rotate through several pv \\s patient: it depends on presentation sometimes theres like one or two other people that have to present that night depending on like how long topic \\s therapist: all right well lets choose last time you presented that classes as template what was order to go in there \\s patient: well one that i really messed up i think in that i was first but usually like im like second maybe \\s therapist: okay so for this example lets say youre through second okay so youre sitting in classroom another student presenting whats going through mind that \\s patient: i feel like i am totally zoned out like im not even paying attention to what that person saying because im so worried about how im gonna mess it up you know im im starting to like be sweaty like my hands are clammy my heart started to race little bit im just totally zoned out on what theyre doing just you know worrying about whats gonna happen when i get up there \\s therapist: so in that moment as youre seated youre not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptoms you have your heart racing bit sweaty palms youre zoned out have you ever felt need desire to like run out of room \\s patient: yes its funny you should say that was little bit hesitant to mention that but i kind of i do i feel like i need to find excuse to like use bathroom or i just need to get out of there \\s therapist: yeah so what do you feel most pressuring you to leave room like what what symptom \\s patient: um \\s therapist: what thoughts are going through your mind right then like so lets take that kind of severe moment when youre youre lets just say still before presentation okay so youre sitting at desk your heart rates elevated youre not focusing on what theyre doing youre zoned out your anxieties high what was going through your mind right then \\s patient: i think im thinking like im gonna bomb this anyway so i might as well just you know not go through stress of having to do it like ive already in my head i know that its going to end badly \\s therapist: so youve already failed \\s patient: right so theres no sense in getting up there maybe if i dont get up there you know i guess it couldnt be any worse so i might as well just leave \\s therapist: are you embarrassed that professor or other students will see that you were really anxious \\s patient: yeah i dont want i figure if i leave people wont will just make me think i was sick or whatever itll be better situation if i just left then happened to see me up there you know sweating all these other symptoms that i have when i actually get up there it would be better just to leave before that starts \\s therapist: okay so so better to be thought ill had to leave because youre saying \\s patient: yeah or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody you know \\s therapist: to have severe anxiety for that buddy then they can very embarrassing that would be very undesirable outcome for you \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so as youre debating that thought because thats coming to your head youre thinking i just need to yeah gotta get out here what happens there so were maybe what 15 minutes before we present so tell me about that so you have that thought you want to flee \\s patient: right im looking at clock saying you know like how much more time in this presentation before i have to go like should i go should i not go what are consequences of running out you know kind of playing out which would be worse \\s therapist: have you ever had to run out \\s patient: um once i went to bathroom to try to like calm myself down or talk to myself or you know like cool off my face um but i came back \\s therapist: you presented then you presented alright so you you survived one of more stressful presentations \\s patient: yeah i almost felt like i was gonna be ill i was so stressed that day \\s therapist: that was very very tough on you what happened on that particular day \\s patient: so typically like i go to load my presentation at this point like i have my new cards or whatever in front of me i am like shaking at this point i am so i dont know if its scared or worried or maybe combination of everything im just like sweating my heart racing like i almost feel dizzy im just so stressed out about whats going to happen then you know im starting to speak then presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so okay so i have to stay up there for duration im just like you know sweating then im wondering like are people looking at me or people can people see it you know am i going to forget something \\s therapist: so some of thoughts are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if youre gonna do poorly on presentation \\s patient: right or they think ive been lazy i didnt prepare are they going to think that you know im dumb or i dont know you know what im doing \\s therapist: so they might they might think less of you as person \\s patient: right or like be judging me okay \\s therapist: yeah so theres number of concerns that kind of going through your mind in that moment so when does this start to turn around so you start presenting 20 minutes you initially get up there get your presentation up on projection monitor yeah when does it start to turn corner \\s patient: um its depends sometimes i settled down little bit but then usually like that i get some sort of rhythm i think then but then it gets anxiety again until i get my grades do you know what i mean im like until because i feel like im gonna do poorly until that happens when \\s therapist: when you receive grades \\s patient: sometimes like she usually doesnt give them that day but like often like next day or day after \\s therapist: so does that intense anxiety that youre having while youre presenting last all way \\s patient: now it definitely like dissipates once i can like go sit down \\s therapist: okay so so sort of next big drop off for symptoms would be when youre done with presentation \\s patient: yeah when eyes are maybe no longer on me theyve moved on to somebody else so i figured like okay they forgot about me im safe \\s therapist: all right then but then theres this other worry of now we have to see what grades are right \\s patient: i convince myself that i did poorly \\s therapist: so thought going through your mind im gonna receive bad grade \\s patient: yeah that everyone saw me you know sweating all these symptoms that i have everyone judging me",
            "The patient is worried and it is hard for them to focus. The patient is not able to present to the class successfully. If it their turn to present next, they zone out completely, heart racing, sweating and think of walking out. The patient once walked out of a presentation, but came back and presented. The patient is anxious if the people could see them sweating and other symptoms, or if they think the patient hasn't prepared. The patient feels they might be judged. After the presentation, the patient's anxiety level immediately drops once they are seated and everyone's eyes are off them. But then, they are anxious about their grades next which will be given in a day or two for which the patient convinces themselves that they did poorly. "

sorry to hear that i know you were you were excited you were feeling hopeful for change i dont get that same sense from you right now in fact it seems like youre feeling pretty sad maybe even little hopeless about that situation well how can i make how can i be helpful supportive useful to you right now \\s patient: i just i dont i dont know how to make change i dont know how to i dont know how to end this i dont know how to get out i dont know how to i just i cant do it anymore \\s therapist: so youve decided to make change in fact it sounds like youve decided to leave relationship \\s patient: i dont know i mean i want to i dont want to be in it but i dont i dont know how to get to not being in it \\s therapist: so youre thinking about it its not that youve committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave relationship but correct me if im wrong what youre saying you want to make change you dont want this relationship as it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: now what what are you when you think about changing what what ideas i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change what that might look like \\s patient: i dont know it just feels so overwhelming when i think about it i just i cant seem to find way out of it that feels feels ethical it feels like it can no i dont want to hurt her i just dont want to be in this relationship anymore \\s therapist: why dont you want to be in this relationship anymore \\s patient: its not healthy its im not happy i cant imagine that shes happy even though she says she its you know were fighting constantly i feel like im walking on eggshells with her shes overprotective she just it doesnt feel right just doesnt feel right \\s therapist: it doesnt feel right so what would feel right \\s patient: ah thats huge question i just dont im not sure just this isnt right \\s therapist: so way things are not right its not working you dont feel supported this isnt kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be \\s patient: yeah i mean when we started it was it was lovely she was amazing she was this super caring thoughtful woman you know we are lots of same interests you know same friends its you know she was just fantastic i dont know i dont know where that changed i feel like we did this on again off again stuff its just it just seems like just not right i know i know i dont deserve to be treated this way i know that im im better than that \\s therapist: you really value your self your well being in your spirit it sounds like you dont feel like youre taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship even though things started out well they havent turned out to be kind of relationship that you want for yourself \\s patient: no but you know but shes lovely i love her i cant imagine i cant imagine my life without her in it \\s therapist: so you feeling torned \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre youre torned between your love affection for her your sense of honoring yourself youve got lot of mixed feelings you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like youre able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that youve got these strong feelings for this person you dont feel like this good relationship for you \\s patient: no i think its not good for either one of us \\s therapist: for both of you yeah so so then youve talked little bit about leaving i mean tell me more about what you thought about when you think about making change in terms of leaving what what might that look like for you \\s patient: i dont know i mean it feels i just cant imagine my life without her in it so idea of not having her there feels really scary idea of staying way it things not changing feels even scarier so i dont i dont know how to i dont even know how i would do that our lives are so intertwined i mean my business our friends queer community so small you know thats my family as much as my friends my family as well so just you know how do you how do you extract yourself from that in way for me like in way that i feel im doing that with grace respect for her respect for myself \\s therapist: what what thoughts do you have about how you do that how do you extract yourself how might you extract yourself in way that has some integrity grace as you said \\s patient: i dont i dont even know i mean talk to my friend jay about it i dont know he suggested like break but i dont i dont know i just dont want to get caught in that on again off again before like you know like weve done before but idea of break feels little less i dont know maybe more gentle i dont know \\s therapist: say more little more gentle \\s patient: i dont know how to give us both time to really think about it i dont know maybe maybe shell change maybe maybe if im you know if this it if this it like if this break it maybe maybe shell be able to change \\s therapist: i heard you say that live it you know moving on having life without kelly really scary in fact its almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with way that your lives are so intertwined i also heard you say that thought of not making change scarier i was wondering if you could say little bit more about what you mean by that \\s patient: its just i feel exhausted i feel like im not im not who i was when i came into this relationship i feel like im constantly struggling to make her happy that just doesnt work theres nothing i can do i feel like ive lost my joy i dont know im just afraid of what will happen if i just keep staying in place where i feel like im falling apart hmm my piece \\s therapist: yeah so youre concerned about your own well being your own joy your your spirit if you you stay dont make this change thats part thats really scary for you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking little break you said that that was scary thought for you i guess id like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as as an option for you \\s patient: well it seems like i mean if it could happen if we could find way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what i want what i need you know i feel like i cant sort out whats me in this anymore so like if i have that space just to sort of breathe not have to worry about her feelings taking care of her just being able to focus on myself for little while i dont know it seems like that would be helpful \\s therapist: it sounds like youre feeling like youre so in in it just so in mixed emotions sense of hopelessness sadness disappointment that its really hard for you to see out of it an advantage reason to take break would be just to give you moment to breathe look around collect yourself not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well if you dont mind id love to ask you to take look at this ruler here i just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on scale of zero to 10 zero being not motivated at all 10 being extremely motivated how motivated would you say you are to take break in your relationship right now \\s patient: oh six so somewhat motivated \\s therapist: why six not one \\s patient: because i need i need it i feel like im losing myself so i feel like \\s therapist: its important \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well so so why six not nine or 10 \\s patient: cuz im not sure how to make it happen yeah i dont i dont know \\s therapist: so its important to you youre not maybe fully confident or sure about how part \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: how to make it happen \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: well kind of following up on that on scale of zero to 10 zero being not confident at all 10 being extremely confident how confident are you that if you decided to take break from your relationship with kelly you would be successful at making that happen \\s patient: i dont know maybe like three or four \\s therapist: so so less confident or less confident than you are motivated why three not zero \\s patient: because i im on it i mean i do something i want \\s therapist: mm hmm so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: why three not an eight or nine \\s patient: i cant control her i dont know how she would react i just dont want any more arguments anger yeah i dont want to hurt her so \\s therapist: so when you think about taking this break youre also thinking about how she might respond what she might do that creates this whole other kind of set of worries it it undermines your sense of confidence onon some level \\s patient: it creates lot of anxiety for me \\s therapist: yeah what do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take brief break \\s patient: i think i like maybe plan like just knowing knowing what rules are sort of like where where i want to go with it when im home i dont know what i want to accomplish \\s therapist: so thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what boundaries are might might help you \\s patient: yeah regard \\s therapist: okay then one final question on scale of zero to 10 zero being not ready at all 10 being extremely ready how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break in lets say next couple of weeks \\s patient: i think an eight \\s therapist: so pretty ready \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youve spoken to this already little bit i believe but ill ask you again why an eight not one or two \\s patient: because i know if i just let it drag out that im going to be miserable \\s therapist: so your sense of readiness actually really connected to your motivation that that this something you know that you need to do for yourself if you dont things are not going to get any better that that makes you both motivated even more ready well why why an eight not ten \\s patient: thats you know scary change hard thinking about not being woman i thought i was gonna marry that makes me sad \\s therapist: so your emotions your sense of maybe sadness in grief disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness in some way \\s patient: sort of giving up on dream \\s therapist: yeah so another aspect to that to your whole experience says that youre youre grieving relationship isnt even over yet but youre grieving dream hopes that you had thats thats heaviness certainly factor in what you do next \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: well if i could take just moment make sure ive captured understood everything youve shared with me i i know this really difficult to talk about so i really appreciate you spending time to share with me with with this has been like for you youve been feeling stuck things were great for while you had some hope that things were going to change now you are realizing that kellys not going to change that you are suffering in process that you are really being kept from your aspirations your dreams in lot of different regards you know that you need to make change you want to make change you have lot of mixed feelings about this change you know its what you want to do its right thing for you you still really care love kelly youre also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family your friends how they may be affected by breakup in order to make this more manageable youre thinking maybe in terms of smaller change like taking small break as opposed to breaking off relationship you feel like youre pretty ready youre somewhat you know youre motivated then maybe little less confident but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: thats certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if thats alright with you id be happy to hear your ideas maybe even share some suggestions with you about possible plan \\s patient: thatd be great \\s therapist: that alright \\s patient: yeah thank you \\s therapist: thank you very much for your time i really appreciate it",

got your wedding preparations \\s patient: yeah just got engaged weddings just month away now so yeah so just got so much happening work really demanding yeah i just found this exam its just yeah all too much \\s therapist: so imagin youve been sweating on this for while its all been swirling around in your head \\s patient: just been building up so much pressure with everything im living at home so my parents you know lot of pressure need to do everything right by failing this i feel like ive just embarrassed them disappointed them i just dont feel like im good enough to go on studying \\s therapist: okay have they said much to you about filing exam \\s patient: they havent said much i was really scared to tell them actually because i knew they just be so disappointed disinterest by fact that i did fail yeah ive never failed anything before so yes really hard \\s therapist: yeah so its new you dont like it at all \\s patient: not at all i think leaving uni will just be way out just so i dont have to go through it again \\s therapist: okay well im glad youve come to counseling because its good for us to get an outsiders opinion when weve got so much on our plate we confused as to what to do our emotions can get in way you just said earlier that whole lot of stuffs on your plate at moment okay so im glad youve come here here with clinic we use abc model which cognitive behavioral therapy model so marsha some counselors have put together list of beliefs that we often use we dont realize that were using those beliefs they tend to be faulty ones heres least here have look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at moment \\s patient: i think number two \\s therapist: okay read that one out for me \\s patient: that its necessary to have high degree of uncertainty in order to be happy perform well \\s therapist: yeah you mentioned that \\s patient: number 4 that its necessary to be competent successful in all those things which are attempted \\s therapist: hmm yeah thats an expectation from your family \\s patient: yeah possibly number eight that loss should be entirely pleasant ending enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable \\s therapist: hmm yeah which one of those stands out most for you at moment \\s patient: umm probabily number 4 yeah \\s therapist: how would you put that in your own words \\s patient: that i need to be successful all time andeverything that i do \\s therapist: hmm \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: that different from whats happening in your life at moment \\s patient: well failing that exam i mean i wasnt successful with that so yeah it just throws out i guess even number two because throw that all order in my life id need to have everything i need to know what im doing where im going yes \\s therapist: okay so if number four an expectation that your family has given that you have of yourself how do you measure up next to number four \\s patient: i dont feel like im good enough \\s therapist: okay all right well what id like to do put some of those ideas on board under abc ill explain as we go along \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: okay so what do you think trigger point might be or activating event for you at moment \\s patient: i mean there are lot of things but i think obviously filing exam was main one \\s therapist: all right consequences you thinking of leaving uni that statement you made earlier about yeah thats thats one thats crucial one ill explain it shortly when i get up to board \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: okay i think ill put it up there now for you so we can work through that so marsha activating event which what you stated earlier kind of decision that youre thinking about \\s patient: leaving uni \\s therapist: thats right okay so its important that we consider jump from here over to here kind of thinking that youve been swirling around in your head affects consequence youve mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit you put that in your own words what are your words before \\s patient: that im not good enough \\s therapist: its really important for us to consider that kind of thinking hmm okay marsha its good that weve got those things on board what id like to do now focus stepping out bit from your situation looking looking at it from another point of view to me it sounds like youve youre doing whole lot of things really well can you list all of things that youre doing really well \\s patient: im working its really demanding job you know keeping up with it i guess things that my fiance i mean were engaged so planning wedding thats going really well its stressful but its going well \\s therapist: all of you other university subjects \\s patient: yeah never sold anything before this first time i guess all other subjects yeah yeah \\s therapist: youre succeeding in all of those things together \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre juggling it its lot on your plate at moment but it sounds like youve been able to cope up until this point of one exam \\s patient: yeah this one just threw me off balance just failing \\s therapist: so would you describe yourself as successful most of time \\s patient: yeah most of time \\s therapist: yeah whats evidence for that \\s patient: passing all my fans all time im just passing my subjects not getting that full time job its great job that im doing im getting married \\s therapist: yeah thats right yeah so how do all of those successes compared to that belief that youve written that ive written on board for you \\s patient: i guess in comparison i am good enough \\s therapist: yeah thats right yeah all evidence there all of subjects that youve passed in first year now second year year round full time job thats success yeah its great yeah good okay well what id like to do get you to write that on board to dispute that belief okay yeah would you do that \\s patient: alright \\s therapist: well done last thats powerful statement what kind of decision goes along with that \\s patient: staying at uni \\s therapist: good okay knock that on board first \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: alright thats good good okay so youve made bit of decision havent you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay tell me about it does it feel like okay \\s patient: yeah i feel like i should stay \\s therapist: okay why that \\s patient: i can try again everything doesnt have to be 100 all time good good yeah i mean i could reset exam \\s therapist: okay yeah yeah weve talked about all your successes yeah so its hard now to believe that top statement that im not good enough \\s patient: yeah i mean i am good enough compared to all things that you helped me realize with all successes that ive had that i am good enough yeah good \\s therapist: okay so this idea about staying at uni \\s patient: yeah i will stay i am good enough so im sure i can give it another go see how it go from there i can reset exam im sure ill be fine \\s therapist: okay good okay what id like you to do to keep saying that statement i am good enough to say it in front of mirror two or three times day so that you build up your confidence because its going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief we tend to carry those other beliefs for years years years so its going to take bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking change your belief system but youve made great start here today so congratulations \\s patient: thank you",

            "therapist: lets how are you \\s patient: good \\s therapist: its good to see you yeah \\s therapist: again year bench record this week last last week it was like kind of squeaky clean so hows it been feeling im sure it does it really does yeah its been really process so thats fantastic what tell me about whats been going on this week \\s patient: i had good conversation \\s patient: yes i feel good \\s therapist: tell me about it \\s patient: i just talked with her on phone yeah it just went really well we actually after that we had skype meeting skype meeting last night yes it was yeah caught up little bit kind of talked about some things \\s therapist: great yeah oh nice nice happy to hear about that then i dont remember im trying to think from last time like any allen updates or yeah nice things going okay good im happy to hear that then i guess other thing that i wanted to you know talk with you about i know that we you know kind of had mentioned it briefly but today kind of marks kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over next you know three sessions were going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together ive been feeling that way too because its like its hard to its hard to want to bring that up because its really its been really just great working with you so i really dont want to see that come to an end but i thought one of things thats really important maybe just to get us starting to talk about again we dont have to do it all today but just at least get starting to talk about you know some of changes that youve made things that have gone really well for you really maybe kind of recap like how it that youve gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now youre not at all kind of maybe we can kind of talk about how thats gone because i think other thing thats really important not only things that youve done in terms of like how things have gotten better for you but i also want us to start thinking about to like okay whats going to happen when we you know kind of get to end of our work together you know beyond so like in terms of like how will kind of how you will kind of keep work going so ive kind of thought you know like i feel like im kind of being like wet blanket here youve had really great week now im bringing up our kind of departure but i think its really important to kind of mark that mark that transition also to market to by having you know things go so well i think its really important so i guess first thing i want to talk about i guess im pointing my my pad of paper because its like its so filled with just all different things that have occurred for you you know over last several weeks i think first thing thats really notable to me i really really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because i know that thats been so hard for you its been so painful you know way that shes treated you in past but that you know i guess im even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich transition youve made in terms of way youve engaged in more genuine way allowed her kind of back into your life it seems like that thats been you know really vital to your you know like getting better so what whats you know in terms of like from your perspective kind of whats that been like for you \\s patient: yeah its kind of emotionally it feels good \\s patient: its nice not butting heads with her cuz \\s therapist: im sure like \\s patient: you want like i want good relationship with my mom i dont i dont choose purposefully to not have good relationship with her yeah it feels really good i feel like i can have better relationships other places as well now because thats healthy \\s therapist: right right money also to i think along with that that kind of strategies i think that youve you know my hunch would be that some of strategies that youve used engage your mom in more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like some of other relationships that youve had you know especially i know that you kathy have gotten closer even fact that youve allowed yourself to kind of you know connect with somebody else like you know with alan you know i know you were talking with me other day about some other friends that youve you know met people that youve really got little bit closer to so thats been really exciting yeah \\s patient: yeah yeah just get to not go home feel terrible right \\s therapist: yeah yeah so then then kind of from from your perspective again you know well talk more about this in you know as you mean i realize im kind of putting you on spot but as youve kind of thought about or thinking about it maybe you can think about it to even from now on to next couple of sessions but just starting to think about like what it that youve really done that you really feel like has been really thats really helped you make changes in way in which youve you know managed your food or your binge eating \\s patient: i mean just really trying to be more positive in my relationships being more open communicating not keeping things in sofia like when i kept things in it kind of bubble up thats what made me want to do something that made me feel better i yeah i mean like something bothers me like immediately express it \\s therapist: bro no ive noticed that as well it seems like that thats been one of important things that youve done its really helped you know with changes that youve made what else feels like that i mean you know i mean obviously thats been really important but what are other things that youve noticed in terms of like you know how its been going \\s patient: i feel better about myself like not having comments from my mom anymore having guy in my life who really likes how i love yeah yeah just yet feeling happier with myself \\s therapist: grades are good no you know things like like were really in good space i think other thing too i was aware of that we you know that youd mentioned to me in particular last time was that i didnt get chance to talk with you as much about it so i think we had so much to talk about last session but i was really struck by fact that you it seems like you havent been as body conscious as you have been in past i didnt know if youve if youve noticed that \\s patient: yeah no i feel like ive known like little bit notice that yeah especially that you bring it up its true \\s therapist: right yeah cuz i know like initially even like there have been times even along way when youll make like you know i didnt feel like it looked very good or i felt like something felt really tight on me or you know i just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me but it seems like that that as weve kind of moved along that theres really been ive really noticed real kind of little bit of shift in way in which youve kind of been regarding yourself it seems like its been little bit different \\s patient: in that hearing like any comments all my mom about any of that stuff right i feel like ive gotten to point where im not concerned like that im going to hear comment right \\s therapist: okay but so im going to go ahead make you talk about it anyway but what did you do in order to be able to get those comments though to stop because obviously i think you did something really significant with her yes \\s patient: i mean i thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put lot of pain on me justin lee i know i was able to let her know that hired scared to tell her that i mean she recognized that yeah yeah she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have lot of friends in high school thats what she i mean she kind of said like her mom said same thing to her \\s therapist: yeah yeah well you know thats really not uncommon when you have you know its funny that just even like not you know like big big research had but it seems like that thats pretty consistent that you know kind of like you know mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters like sometimes its kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like you know kind of criticality about you know shape weight you know some you know really proud of you that you you know kind of had courage to address it with her directly just let her know how you feel because you know i think you know as parent i know that you owe it like you know i always want to try to do right thing you know i always you know i dont purposely want to inflict pain on my children even though my daughters would suggest that i probably do but in general i dont thats not my goal to be you know harsh critical in fact i really was you know try to really be helpful i think most parents try to do right thing but i i think maybe your mom just didnt realize degree to which that really bothered you how much that hurt in many respects how much that kind of really drove you to you know really you know take it out on yourself so to speak so for you to have courage to bring that up i think was really helpful yeah yeah so i really think that that made lot of differences as well as you know kind of reaching out to others again in just open expression of your feelings so yeah so yeah i think things that were doing like now i think id really like to see us kind of continue to you know obviously you still are doing lot of really good work in terms of like things that youre talking about but yet im also aware that you know as were over next couple sessions we kind of keep doing few of these things kind of wrapping up then our last session we can more or less kind of formally you know say goodbye talk about kind of like what next steps are you know some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to you know be mindful of but well get there so yeah \\s patient: great thankyou",

in on me when i start thinking about that its just slow it down so to catch it we can still do this but its we had agreed to sort of look for mr anxiety it looks like hes here oh yeah i found big time \\s therapist: yeah minister asked you this as you start to enter into this this familiar this familiar territory \\s patient: yeah this me all time thats why i came here in first place right so weve been kind of working on trying to stand in different way to it but now were actually going to do something here it big time \\s therapist: very familiar would you say \\s patient: yeah thats very familiar its very disconcerting as well \\s therapist: sure yeah how old would you say those thoughts are like that what you just said do you did you notice there was like an urgency to it they kind of went one after another after another after another like like one led to another another im this going to happen when i get there then this going to happen with me \\s patient: mm hmm yeah no i see what youre saying \\s therapist: how old this whole little i dont mean those exact words but kind of mmaamma \\s patient: i used to happen to him when i was when i was kid you know when even when i was you know before i was teenager okay same same kind of thing you know like my parents would try to take me out to some public place you know mall or street fair or something i just you know in car on way over id be id be wreck \\s therapist: okay so this has history \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: would it be fair to say that what you have been doing sort of turning over your life to that whatever that was youve come in here weve been working now for these weeks getting ready for this moment to try to create space in which something different can happen \\s patient: that was that was what i hope to do yeah i ive missed out on lot because because i cant you know i cant i cant keep it together enough to you know do stuff that other people do \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: go to places other people go \\s therapist: okay so now were up on or right up on where action happens like what do you do when you have thoughts like what you just had because youre not there yet were not yet actually in situation where those things are happening yet but we are right here where those things are being conceived with me on this \\s patient: yeah i think i see \\s therapist: okay so what can we see this sort of kind of slow this down watch it were about to do something here it comes could we take can i just do something i want to i want to do something in terms of creating history i want to create history right here instead of cap something like what this would what does how mind works hmm could we do something kind of odd youre gonna play so let me do something \\s patient: yeah if you want as well \\s therapist: okay okay ive got pen here \\s patient: yes you do \\s therapist: it says something heres what it says it says \\s patient: pen says whoo \\s therapist: okay what does it say \\s patient: it says whoo \\s therapist: okay we just did it twice you suppose if i come back in here next week we sit down i said versus say what what do you think said \\s patient: yeah ill say it as whoo \\s therapist: next month \\s patient: ill probably still say whoo huh \\s therapist: how about next year it possible we just did like 15 seconds it possible next year that might come to mind if i said this thing \\s patient: yeah probably still id probably still say whoo \\s therapist: but as long as youve struggled with this with way mind works what do you think going to happen as we come to this day \\s patient: oh i see so ive ive been thinking for years that that ill lose it if i get get into crowd hear whats happening again im thinking about you know \\s therapist: exactly if thats if thats determine determine if thats what were going to turn it over tomean were were never like inside letting that run your life what brought you in here think of all cost that its produced so lets see if we can do something different i got ticket ticket moment to sort of get in touch with how old this cost associated with me on this yeah this pen goes \\s patient: whoo \\s therapist: mary had little \\s patient: plan \\s therapist: if i go to mall \\s patient: im gonna lose it \\s therapist: okay world working as it should mind working perfectly its doing what minds do thats not your that your enemy \\s patient: no no i guess thats just what happens \\s therapist: it \\s patient: if i can learn that pen goes whoo in two seconds \\s therapist: okay so heres what id like to ask were about to get up go do this thing we agree it sounds like your mind engaged we did it to find mr anxiety right so its like were here were right on this pivot point where were going to do something different heres thing id like to ask you its different but with regard to that would you be willing to do this as you go you can tell me whats coming coming up i want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures just notice it like sort of like way you carry something thats fragile wants you to just to set notice like its not your enemy its not your boss its your mind doing its thing would you be willing to sort of do it that spirit lets see whats there this kind of watch it go \\s patient: yeah i can try yeah but i can feel yeah i think its my mind kicking in telling me that im going to fall apart \\s therapist: yeah good catch so even that even that thought that came up as i said that lets do this okay \\s patient: yeah i guess it \\s therapist: how anxiety \\s patient: yeah but im not sure that i can i can do it ive been just beside myself ever since last week thinking that i was gonna have to go through this im not sure i can i mean chest tight like no sweat running down my back im petrified you know i suit youre afraid of like what kind of no i actually \\s therapist: you go there thinking whats gonna happen \\s patient: yeah im gonna im gonna lose it im gonna lose it before i get inside front door lose it anyway i couldnt predict \\s therapist: whats going to happen \\s patient: but i dont know pass out i go crazy its i hate crowds i hate being around those people you know i know i said i would i know that we plan that we go over there but its just too much i just cant do it \\s therapist: okay thats surprising youd be thinking this this an old thought its its where you started i mean its how youve been thinking \\s patient: yeah thats true but that doesnt mean its not true \\s therapist: but well let me just that ask you this terms of truth that truth means different things but in all these years youve been thinking things like that have you actually lost it \\s patient: no no but i havent i havent really done it much cheaper \\s therapist: then once ive been able to test it to see if its really true \\s patient: yeah i mean you know once or twice maybe ive managed to spend little time in crowd \\s therapist: so far appeared as as far as you know this just thought \\s patient: yeah i guess thats true i dont have any any evidence that it would absolutely happen alone sure as hell feels like its gonna happen \\s therapist: so well you know be one thing its worth noticing that something that for us to kind of hang on to when we go there that when your mind gets on you there that you remember this just thought its not true as far as you know from as far as we know correctly \\s patient: yeah i mean i guess \\s therapist: okay no not true can i do something thats little odd just little silly to kind of look at this in different way \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: were gonna have to do something different were not going to get anything different \\s patient: that makes sense \\s therapist: so give me cartoon character that to like \\s patient: donald duck \\s therapist: okay donald duck so suppose these thoughts were actually something that was like what kind of thoughts would come up if you go to mall its whats gonna happen \\s patient: its gonna be go to car sir walking towards entrance its just gonna be bad its gonna be terrible \\s therapist: okay so your donald duck says bad \\s patient: thats ridiculous \\s therapist: well first you know thoughts are similarly ridiculous i mean here you sort of turning your life over to things that you dont know are true that could just be silly thought about what kind of thoughts would come up there could we actually go there in mentally i could do you sort of have your thoughts being donald duck horse just so that you can see them as something thats silly which may be able to give you little bit of freedom from them because you know what happens if you just turn you know turn your life over huh \\s patient: yeah i mean i guess they are pretty silly thoughts im not sure that i can do that voice quite so well \\s therapist: versus result of misspent youth what other kind of thoughts yeah like if you go \\s patient: yeah you know if i if i go am i gonna lose im gonna hyperventilate yeah i see we come from yeah thats well \\s therapist: i just want you to sort of hang on to that little bit when it really gets up on you so that you can remember these things are not true as far as you know theres it kind of silly thing to allow them to do what theyve done so well just you tell me what they are if you cantdo it mentally in your head ill say it out loud i can probably say most of these thoughts donald back wise would you be willing to do it that way \\s patient: yeah well i have to say i think make it lot easier just distract but \\s therapist: never mindwhat would you say \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so whats inside this decision \\s patient: well i just get really nervous because im supposed to choose i have one more semester left i get worried because im not sure if im on right paths i dont want to make wrong decisions then my parents are telling me you know my dad wants me to do one thing i feel like i just get it thrown in lots of different directions then my teachers tell me one thing i just feel like theres six of me trying to do different things \\s therapist: if you could settle them down just to to two major ones what would be two major alternatives that you have here \\s patient: well i mean ultimately my family i still want to have friends im really young still i get then career choices wanting to be successful \\s therapist: okay which of those more important you think \\s patient: well i mean i definitely feel lot better when im around people that i love stuff but then also ive always been told careers most important thing making money all that but i just i just keep feeling like im failing \\s therapist: okay so it seems like if you do one you dont get other if thats really true are there things in there where you could do both \\s patient: well i mean i feel like if im committed to school then im committed to school i just dont have time \\s therapist: yet it does does take time but not forever \\s patient: or no but for now \\s therapist: seems like youre kind of almost anxious when you talk about it here \\s patient: yeah its it makes me i just cant really because i dont know i just dont know what right direction to go in \\s therapist: i dont know maybe you just need to follow your heart here make choice but how long have you been sitting on this fence its obviously it seems like youre sitting on fence \\s patient: well i mean i guess since i had to choose which college to go to in high school \\s therapist: there any other way to do it other than just nike solution just do it \\s patient: i dont i dont see it i mean i feel like i am just doing it im just not going anywhere with it okay \\s therapist: maybe were just not thinking about it broadly enough in an open enough way \\s patient: i feel like im covering all bases \\s therapist: oh whats inside this choice i guess \\s patient: well i just feel like i get torn into different pieces trying to please my family my friends but then also trying to be motivated to choose career which i still dont know what i want to do \\s therapist: even as you say that theres sort of sense that were entering into kind of chattery world do you feel as though youre kind of getting into space \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: like if we were to just do it metaphorically like how close are your thoughts about am i doing right thing if we use distance as metaphor for how close to have sense that \\s patient: yeah yeah blinding \\s therapist: yeah yeah exactly that that pretty familiar place to be \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so not just in this area right \\s patient: no \\s therapist: without without any other decisions choices so its just worth noticing that you know thats kind of how your mind works probably trying to help you out here but its doing something thats probably pretty familiar but what would happen if we kind of just sort of noticed more openly what your minds doing also just whats showing up for you in your body your emotions we look at sec nice notice kind of almost holding \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: like this decision has been made now \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so come back to it now just sort of watch your mind kind of come up like this see if we can just kind of watch it there okay so you do have choice to make theres only one i mean life finite dont get to do everything right right yeah thats little scary yeah so what does your mind start saying to you \\s patient: well i feel like every time i make positive decision to go one way its leaving another thing behind then i hold on to thing that im going to be missing out on \\s therapist: yeah exactly so just before dont grab that so provide them close just didnt notice that okay would that be okay to have that sort of sense i dont know if i made right decision like whats inside that would it be okay to have that thought \\s patient: its scary to not know \\s therapist: yeah it \\s patient: but i mean i guess i dont really have control over that okay \\s therapist: could we sort of open up it little scary we make choices you do open doors you close others \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: even that sounds bit scary that okay theres something supposed to happen here when you make career choices it not supposed to have any scariness to it \\s patient: well it scary so yeah \\s therapist: so lets see if we can just kind of open up to that but thats okay too youre not doing anything wrong here its not an indication something bad happening here \\s patient: right",

            "therapist: hello maria its nice to see you \\s patient: hello i wish i could say its nice to see you but its never good to go to doctor \\s therapist: fortunately for me i hear that lot so were going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots options for treatment but first id like to check in on few things first youre smoking you were to half pack at during your last visit we talked about how important it for to quit id say its even more important now that smoking associated with dvt so have you quit \\s patient: no i havent quit \\s therapist: so deep do you remember our conversation from our last visit thats when i give you information about quitting smoking contact number for tobacco treatment specialist \\s patient: yes i remember but no i didnt quit no i didnt call her \\s therapist: why that \\s patient: im not ready im too upset to talk about this i dont mean to be rude doctor but ive had hard time lately im not in mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting ill let you know when im ready we can talk about it but here now today im here to talk about my blood clots \\s therapist: well were on same page then because thats exactly why im talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking major risk factor for dvt even if you even if we treat you now if you dont quit smoking im afraid blood clots will return again \\s patient: lets just talk about my treatment right now okay \\s patient: i havent really thought about it actually i thought about canceling this appointment because i knew youre going to bring it up again \\s therapist: talking about smoking with me as hard for you \\s patient: yes its because youre going to tell me to quit like you always do limit filter just like everyone else like my caseworker building manager everybody seems to they know what i need to do nobody thinks i know anything \\s therapist: so when it comes to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do make your decisions for you you dont feel heard or respected \\s patient: no respect thats it yes \\s therapist: well i just want to say that i am very glad you decided to come in today so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious i know youre concerned as your provider i have to be honest say that smoking can cause blood clots but hopefully some of information i give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking now having said that i know my opinion not deciding factor quitting smoking as decision only you can make \\s patient: well im really glad i came into i have to get this blood clot condition under control i know that \\s therapist: would it be okay with you if i share some information about smoking blood clots i can tell you what i know then well see what you think \\s patient: yes i dont know that i will quit but i will listen \\s therapist: so what do you think \\s patient: i always thought that blood clots came from my mother hello like passed down like genetics i didnt know that smoking could cause this i just thought that blood clots ran in my family i guess i also didnt get how dangerous this clotting can be \\s therapist: you seem surprised little more aware now of smoking risks \\s patient: i guess so yes \\s therapist: so maria id like to get better sense of what you think about smoking so on scale of one to 10 with one being you dont think it at all important that you quit 10 being youre ready to quit today where would you put yourself \\s patient: well if you had asked me when i first came in i would have said less than one but now i would have to say four \\s therapist: why four not lower number \\s patient: thats good question let me think about it \\s patient: i guess its four because of blood clots blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now \\s therapist: so having better understanding of how smoking adds to risk of blood clots increases your desire to quit \\s patient: little yes \\s therapist: what else if anything makes quitting important to you \\s patient: know bigger thing for me fear of being evicted from my apartment theres rule that we can smoke in house i stick to it for most part but other day i smoked out window that was only second time ive done it but dont you know building manager caught me so now i am sure shes going to be watching me even more i cant lose my part with \\s therapist: possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you in addition to your health \\s patient: i would hate to think that my sogdian they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over abiding by stupid code even if i hate that rule i smoked when i was pregnant with them thank you holy mother they were born healthy i dont think i could live with myself if they lost their home because of something im doing \\s therapist: so it sounds like your priority in life taking care of providing for your children its obvious that youre good mom if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear \\s patient: yes they would \\s therapist: so let me ask you slightly different question on that same scale of one to 10 how would you rate your confidence to quit \\s patient: confidence id have to say at two \\s therapist: so you are not feeling very confident right now \\s patient: who oh no not confident at all i mean ive tried to quit so many times i just cant do it \\s therapist: so youve been persistent trying havent been successful yet still you you set two not one im curious about that \\s patient: well only reason i said are two that i tried quitting smoking when i was pregnant with santhi they are both i went for two months without cigarette with dale i didnt make it past that that was really mad at myself for that i really wanted to quit from my babies i failed i guess im just hopeless i mean who keeps smoking when theres baby inside \\s therapist: sounds like you really feel like you let yourself your children down thats hard to accept given how much you love your kids \\s patient: yes im doing it again right now by not following rules im addicted to cigarettes just like drug addict in end cigarettes always with \\s therapist: so what what do you think santa to think about your smoking \\s patient: santhi yells at me sometimes theyll cry when i go out to smoke he says mama smoking bad \\s therapist: so you know it would be best for you your children if you quit if you had right support tools to manage this addiction if you believed you could do it you would \\s patient: i would like to do so but i just dont think i can do it \\s therapist: you quit for two months when you were pregnant with tail \\s therapist: how did you do with them \\s patient: i dont know i just did it i fought urges with sucking on straws some hard kellys i just did it \\s therapist: so you were able to quit on your own for two months thats impressive have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups \\s patient: no i think people can quit if they really want to im just too weak \\s therapist: ah wow you must be pretty hard on yourself what would you say if i told you that very few people only 4 of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey \\s patient: no there really that true huh \\s therapist: yes most people try many times before theyre successful their medications groups at id be happy to share that information with you id like to help you if thats something that youd like \\s patient: well i dont know im let me think about it can you give me information again booklet brochure you gave me before i didnt want to tell you but i threw them away when i got home but i really want to read them this time \\s therapist: thats great maria \\s therapist: you can look them over ill have our tobacco treatment specialist sonia follow up with you we have an excellent tobacco treatment program here i am i believe that sonia can help you quit when youre ready right what when would be good time to check back in \\s patient: she can call me next week number two i may be ready to try again \\s therapist: absolutely ill have sonia call you i just want you to know that i understand how hard it for you to talk about quitting smoking i really appreciate it \\s therapist: so would you like to talk about how to manage blood clots yes \\s patient: that sounds good all right",

            "therapist: hi kylie how are you doing today \\s patient: im pretty good how are you dr grande \\s therapist: im doing im doing well thanks for asking whats been going on \\s patient: um so ive ive been applying to doctor programs for this upcoming fall im like im kind of stuck because i got into two of schools that that i was looking at i get like i got into both of them both of their programs are really good both of them have like great research track records kind of what i want to do \\s therapist: right \\s patient: yeah but problem like i dont know how to decide between two now \\s therapist: okay so you you applied to two places you got them both \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: it sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do \\s patient: right \\s therapist: youre having difficulty deciding which one to go with \\s patient: yeah um yeah like ive always ive always had trouble like within decisiveness its like when i when i had two choices of something thats very similar like i always i always get stuck i like its very hard for me to actually like make decision \\s therapist: lets are start to beginning you definitely want to go on for phd okay so weve established that \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so its going to be one of these programs either way so really only question youre really left with which one \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so oftentimes these situations we look at pros cons right are there any well it sounds like theres lot of pros to each one are there any cons to one \\s patient: i mean really not not any that i can think of like ive tried to like ive tried to write them down piece of paper do pros cons like pros look very close its like same number but i mean both programs are good i have connections with like some of teachers both of them theyre both in same city like theyre really close to each other theyre theyre both very similar but like for some reason i just i dont know it would be easier if theres like some cons to one of them \\s therapist: it will make decision easier if you had some negatives that for one of programs \\s patient: right \\s therapist: there for other one so in way you know i guess this we call quote unquote good problem \\s patient: right \\s therapist: its problem but youre choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you but its there choice right its still tough you mentioned before that you had some in your past youre indecisive \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so maybe we can do in this process help you build decision making skills or contribute to that ability because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose youre gonna have to make decisions later on to \\s patient: right \\s therapist: probably vary or maybe some of those will be easier maybe some of those choices wont be as easy so i think this would be matter of looking at whats important to you but you mentioned research agenda already or agendas at both universities thats important too \\s patient: right \\s therapist: what are aspects maybe not so much thinking about these two universities but in general if you had to rank order them what aspects are really most important \\s patient: um well definitely research up there i definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school i go to i think something else thats important for university to have kind of like maybe post doctorate plan whether they have connections with like businesses where i can get job like right after graduate or like if i was going to move into faculty position like if they kind of had pathway that would help set me up for that like that those are probably biggest like biggest influencers \\s therapist: research not guarantee necessarily but some high probability employment \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so really what we could do here if you want to look at these two universities even though we dont really have any negatives to look at we can rank these positives so it sounds like both have research that youre looking for that \\s patient: bright \\s therapist: theyre both there but if you could rank maybe you dont have this information right now but if you could rank them in terms of next most important aspect which really how hard will you work to find job \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats thats kind of what youre saying \\s patient: okay right \\s therapist: i mean it sounds like what youre saying \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so do you have any information or that something you can find \\s patient: um actually thats i never thought about like that like i guess i could go online kind of look at lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards they put up percentages kind of like what what people do afterwards so maybe if i looked at websites kind of found information see like how many of them go on to be professors or like work in industry maybe maybe i should check that out that might help me \\s therapist: that might allow you to have difference between them because right now its like theyre just kind of theyre kind of melded together \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you know you have you have really no way yet to separate them \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so maybe this can build bit of discrepancy that gap between them so you can say okay this one neither one bad right but this one might be little better for what i want to do \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: does that does that kind of make sense \\s patient: yeah that makes sense yeah \\s therapist: similarly as i think about it i know whenever i leave speaking with somebody or some situation thats right i always think of all questions i want to ask right so when you leave here you can consider some of other aspects like think it over like really important to me try to create that distance between them so you can look at them as really two separate entities another possibility would be to find out this information maybe talking to representatives from each university \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: if they may or may not have more information about potential pros they might even have some cons right now im sure theyll present plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of negatives \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: associated with other university or maybe some of positives that arent quite as positive \\s patient: right right \\s therapist: something that they do well with others other university doesnt do as well \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: so it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step \\s patient: yeah yeah i never actually thought about ranking pros going from there so i think thats good idea yeah \\s therapist: one of things that might be helpful to drive importance you place on these different aspects right so kind of clarify we can we meet again well talk about this but clarify your values whats important to you \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: then thatll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes \\s patient: right okay yeah that makes sense \\s therapist: all right lets lets leave it there well kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about unless you have any further questions \\s patient: no no i think yeah i think i know what i can do afterwards no we decided \\s therapist: so ill see you in about week well pick up there \\s patient: alright sounds good \\s therapist: thanks kyle \\s patient: hmm",
            "Patient is applying for a doctor programs but is stuck between two schools because both the schools have great research tracks. Patient is not getting which program to choose. The patient always had such kind of trouble in making the decision. Therapist asked to make pros and cons table but both the programs were good, so therapist asked cons of the programs. Patient told the pros are very similar but didn't know about cons that much. Therapist started a process to improve decision making skills of patient. Therapist asked to look at the rank of the universites and list down the general benefits of these two schools like post graduation or placement after the program etc. Therapist also told that rank these universities according to the positive points they have. Therapist asked to collect such information and rank them before the next aspect. Patient got to know that patient could go online and put up job acceptance, then it will show a percentage and how many people got jobs as a professor or in industry. Therapist gave an example like whenever patient talk to a therapist, patient will ask all the questions but while leaving consider only the things according to the aspects. If they may not have more information about pros so they consider negative points of the therapist, likewise it is associated with the universities. Some are positive and some aren't quite as positive. So it will give you a clarity regarding choosing either of the unversities."

was kind of like when anxiety was just starting so it wasnt too big of problem so i like i quit there because it wasnt really doing that much yeah \\s therapist: you take marijuana for any other reason other than to help with anxiety \\s patient: i mean like if im bored or maybe if im like hanging out with buddies like i dont really have reason not to do it i can tell now but it wasnt like like i really use it whenever im like feeling really anxious about something \\s therapist: so you may not be able to answer this question but if you didnt have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana \\s patient: if i didnt have like any kind of anxiety \\s therapist: hmm \\s patient: umm like it was so be kind of tough to give up because like if im hanging out with my buddies they offer it to me like thats thats always pretty chill but i dont like i really im really looking forward to this job like benefits of having that job without weighing benefits of just like smoking smoking with my buddies so \\s therapist: so youre excited about job \\s patient: i am yeah its its almost kind of dream job \\s therapist: really tell me about \\s patient: well its working with its working with kids with autism in school so like i would be kind of like almost like personal ta in way so like its part of an inclusion program so when kids are going into class like i would either sit with them or like maybe back behind class kind of like help them out in case something comes up its just my brother has autism thats like its thats something that ive always really kind of wanted to work with \\s therapist: so it sounds like your real passion for this type of work \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: really big obstacle here this marijuana \\s patient: it its like catch 22 because its like i know job will be great but its like its its big step for me to take that job its its gonna be super umm its gonna make me super anxious you know its gonna be like its gonna be lot of anxiety taking new job so its like if i have to give up marijuana then like not have another way to cope with anxiety like to get job its like catch 22 \\s therapist: yeah its predicament youre kind of weighing both sides of this right now im wondering do you have do you think youd have like physical craving for marijuana \\s patient: no i mean not really no \\s therapist: so youre really using it recreationally as an anti anxiety agent \\s patient: yeah yeah pretty much \\s therapist: so if you were i know you didnt have great success before therapy to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety working that job which seems like you would really like do you think youd be able to stay with marijuana \\s patient: i think if therapy really worked i would be able to like its just so easy now just to kind of light up like thats an easy fix like i dont think therapy going to be that instant so like it would it would be tough i think if i had real confidence that therapy would work i could do it but i mean it was i have to it would definitely have to work like i just as well as as smoking \\s therapist: you would need to see results \\s patient: yeah yeah definitely \\s therapist: would having job that youre passionate about reduce your anxiety \\s patient: after while like after i got used to this job but like just starting new job would make me kind of anxious then like it would be tough not not to smoke or doing that like i dont i dont want to get on drug test anymore because like its its being decriminalized being legalized so many places theres so much research saying that its not that bad its kind of like its really upsetting that place that i really want to work sas that policy i think its really silly \\s therapist: youre frustrated marijuana illegal \\s patient: yeah its yeah \\s therapist: at same time its reality youre living in \\s patient: right yeah its either they will be legalized in like in state in couple of years but until then likei mean i cant wait that long to start start working so \\s therapist: until then you still need to address this dilemma \\s patient: right yeah its still problem \\s therapist: so you have choices here right you can continue to use marijuana not take job \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: because you would really like that job \\s patient: yeah i would its it sounds so pathetic to be like no i dont want to take my dream job because i need weed like sounds really stupid \\s therapist: so where do you think you are in terms of making this change do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it \\s patient: i dont like im im still kind of on fence because like if i if i have to give it up for job i could do that but i would definitely need like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety like whether its therapy or whether its like something else i yeah i would i would definitely need like substitute if i got rid of it for good \\s therapist: so you definitely definitely need it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so you cant give up marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats thats key to you to make this change \\s patient: yeah yeah definitely \\s therapist: but at same time that would be ideal because then you could take job \\s patient: right yeah i mean i mean if i really thought that i could like get some kind of treatment that was as good as weed yeah i mean i could maybe quit especially house to get job especially \\s therapist: so with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase then you could take job that you want \\s patient: yeah yeah i mean that would be best best outcome \\s therapist: that outcome you would most want \\s patient: yeah i think so i think i could give up record like doing it with my buddies recreationally i could yeah im just going to have cigarette \\s therapist: so heres what im thinking let me know what you think about this when you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety when we start you know i start treating anxiety well see if we can get it reduced kind of work from there because maybe when you start to feel if that works that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like itll just be easier for you to stop marijuana usage \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: what kind of timeframe are you on in terms of taking this job \\s patient: i mean job it has high turnover rate so like even if i think i need to apply this week but if i dont get in more than likely another position like it will open up like within month or two \\s therapist: when would they drug test you \\s patient: it would be like oh all right after i apply so i applied then did interview thats when they will give him paperwork i have to go get drug tested on \\s therapist: when did last time you use marijuana \\s patient: just couple days ago \\s therapist: to see what im getting that \\s patient: yeah yeah its uh yeah so i like i wouldnt be able to do i wouldnt be able to make it this application but i would like to be off it by next one \\s therapist: so youre fortunate in sense that turnover high \\s patient: right \\s therapist: because it gives you an opportunity to apply later on so do you feel like you can invest in that plan lets work on anxiety see what happened with marijuana see if we can reduce your usage of it or have you stop that altogether then kind of move towards this job \\s patient: yeah yeah i could deal with that \\s therapist: right so next time you come in well start talking about anxiety lets see what we can do about that well kind of move from there \\s patient: all right yeah sounds good \\s therapist: sounds good \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: thanks kylie \\s patient: thank you",

Also patients don't know about giving up on marijuana. Patient is worrying about a panic attack if the patient completely quit smoking. Patient already had therapy for anxiety, but it was the initial stage, so it didn't make any difference. Patient doesn't have a reason not to consume marijuana. Patient used to do it whenever it feels like anxiety. Patient is confused between selecting the job or the marijuana. Therapist asked if the therapy started along with your dream job will you leave the marijuana.? If the therapy worked, the patient was fine to leave marijuana and smoking as well. Patient don't want to do a drug taste because it seems silly. Therapist asked to select an option like marijuana or a dream job. Patient still confused like patient needs dream job but also wants something to fight anxiety, whether its a marijuana or a therapy. Therapist told to have any other alternatives to fight anxiety to get the job. Patient told the therapist that patient would have only cigarette.  Therapist told the anxiety therapy will start from next week if the patient anxiety level is reduced. Because if it reduced it will be easy to quit marijuana."

            "therapist: hi kyle how have you been \\s patient: im not too good man \\s therapist: not too good \\s patient: yeah so something happened over this past week i was i was driving to my buddys house i forgot that my tags for my car expired earlier this month so i got pulled over for that then i dont know why i did this but cop asked to search my car i was like yeah thats fine like whatever because he said he had two searches this getting towed i completely forgot that i had my junk bag in trunk so we opened trunk he was looking through bag so he found me he found everything i had my weed in there at bottom pipe like all my pieces so i got i got in trouble for possession so i just i just want him to court judge offered me this decision he said that i could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours or i could pay 1000 fine im trying to im really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better i guess both kind of suck but \\s therapist: so youre struggling with decision between two options you perceived as negative right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: now weve discussed marijuana usage before was just probably root of this problem right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: but it sounds like you didnt really want to explore change this time \\s patient: no i mean its its really not problem like its just they dont really want it problem that i got caught like im doing good in school works fine so obviously like marijuana other than just going to court it has never been problem \\s therapist: so lets focus on this decision then \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so decision between couple weeks of community service what kind of community service \\s patient: just picking up crap inside of road \\s therapist: or 1000 fine \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: do you have thousand dollars \\s patient: i do but i have i got vacation coming up i definitely like i want to i want to keep money for like little little vacation wed like do some some fun stuff with my buddies definitely like i want to keep that money but i mean i also like community service like also kind of close to vacation so i might have to like give up part of vacation or to to do two weeks so that i think that didnt really help my decision either \\s therapist: do you see any value in either one of these options which all become negative \\s patient: i mean really like they both they both have same negative i guess like like if i if i do community service that i like you know i do get to keep money but i mean other hand like if i keep money im doing community service like im not gonna have all time to spend money so its now i mean neither really have positive both negatives are kind of equal to so its its kind of tough to choose \\s therapist: so lets talk about whats important to try to help you make this decision really what youre going to have to determine what i want to explore importance of keeping money right because thats really what this comes down to \\s patient: right \\s therapist: you you keep it you do service or you spend it you dont do service \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so you could you could say that its about importance of keeping money rr you could say its about importance of avoiding community service \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so lets talk little about that what how would you say on scale of one to 10 where 10 very important how would you scale keeping money \\s patient: i mean thats obviously pretty high like i guess keeping money itd be like nine because if i like if i if i keep money obviously i can like use it for other other things id say probably nine \\s therapist: so keeping in mind thats thats very important to you \\s patient: right \\s therapist: so that scenario would be would lean more toward completing community service \\s patient: right yeah i mean i guess thats true like i didnt think about it in that way like if i if i give up two weeks of time like obviously that would suck but like i have i guess i have more of choice of what to do with money compared to my time you know so i guess i could think about it that way maybe \\s therapist: well lets look at other side too how important it for you on scale of one to 10 to avoid community service so we know its nine right to keep money \\s patient: right \\s therapist: how to avoid community service \\s patient: maybe like i guess maybe about seven because like community service i mean it wouldnt be that bad obviously like it would be waste of time were gonna have to do this crap work for for so long but i dont know like at least i know if i do community service it would be like done after this amount of time you know so i can i can always keep that in mind \\s therapist: so as youre talking it seems like youre leaning toward or maybe youre leaning toward completing service even though youre not happy with either choice right \\s patient: right \\s therapist: that might be least objectionable \\s patient: yeah yeah yeah i guess cuz i never like i never thought about scaling it like that way so yeah i think so \\s therapist: when do you have to make this decision by \\s patient: by end of week so todays tuesday so i have like couple of days to think it over \\s therapist: you go back before judge on friday \\s patient: on friday yeah when i get decision \\s therapist: once you weigh some of factors with way this importance of money versus doing community service \\s patient: right \\s therapist: lets meet again just before maybe on thursday okay lets meet again thursday just talk about it take look at your decision making process making sure that youve made decision that you can be most happy with i know neither option happy option for you \\s patient: right \\s therapist: theyre one thats least destructive for you least negative for you \\s patient: right \\s therapist: thats sounds like plan \\s patient: all right yeah i think i can do that yeah give me some more \\s therapist: good then ill see there \\s patient: yep sounds good \\s therapist: take care",

make sense \\s patient: yeah okay \\s therapist: so how are you referred here to our agency \\s patient: well i have this friend that ive known for forever she told me that she was really concerned about way i was living my life that you know i shouldnt be coming here so as favor to her im here \\s therapist: do you feel committed to counseling \\s patient: i mean i guess theres some things i

not people \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so do you view anger as problem you want to work on \\s patient: i guess i could work on being less angry i dont think i have anger problem but i can be less angry \\s therapist: okay so so one of symptoms would be anger you dont necessarily necessarily feel like its large problem but you could be less angry \\s patient: yeah youd be okay i think everybody can work on being little more peaceful \\s therapist: okay that makes sense anything else \\s patient: um no this something i have tried to stop before but im having problem i do smoke marijuana lot of time lot of you lot recently ive been getting into like snorting some drugs \\s therapist: can you tell me what drugs \\s patient: like xanax ive tried to stop before it didnt work

other problems you identify to work on \\s patient: um i can sometimes let my pride get in my way \\s therapist: pride tell me what \\s patient: i dont like being told im doing something wrong because most of time im not or im doing it in way like just because im not doing it your way doesnt mean im doing it wrong i know what i can do i know what im capable of \\s therapist: so somebody telling you that youre acting in way thats proud \\s patient: yeah ive had several people ive lost few friends because over you know little things that i wont budge on for example things like even like what best tv show i know whens best tv show isnt anybody who says any different wrong thats oscars but you know what maybe theyre not real friends \\s therapist: so youre indicating pride but it sounds like maybe inflexibility part of it too i guess anybody ever said that to hear \\s patient: me not that word but let me know that you say it i guess yeah \\s therapist: do you think thats kind of together with pride \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you feel like okay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all right so we have anger mostly objects though \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: not people marijuana

            "therapist: nicole how are doing today \\s patient: im doing well maria \\s therapist: doing well thanks for asking what brings you into our agency today \\s patient: well ive really just been feeling kind of anxious every time i go to work \\s therapist: feeling anxious every time you go to work what type of place to work \\s patient: i work just an insurance company sort of an admin assistant \\s therapist: work for insurance company how long have you been feeling anxious there \\s patient: well ive started little over year ago \\s therapist: have you ever had anxiety like that previous employer or any other place \\s patient: yeah i would say when ive started new jobs or even in new academic environments i would feel somewhat anxious so \\s therapist: this somewhat familiar exciting mm hmm tell me about things i \\s patient: um well it starts you know when i wake up in morning get ready to go to work even when im driving in i just start to get anxious then once im there i really just you know i go to work i do what im supposed to do but i try to keep to myself you know i dont really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers \\s therapist: what it that happens when you try to interact with \\s patient: um i guess i just i havent really connected with any of them i i tend to worry about whether im doing my job right or if they like me things like that so its just easier to stick to my my own office \\s therapist: okay so you have an office have separate offices you find yourself maybe isolating little bit yeah \\s patient: i guess you could say that \\s therapist: so what what your experience of anxiety when youre kind of im sure there are situations diaries more or less have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety \\s patient: you mean how im feeling or what type of situations that happens in \\s therapist: well lets cover both lets start with what type of situations triggers it \\s patient: okay um i guess whenever im in big crowd purchase with bunch of coworkers if we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something i tend to get nervous i just wonder you know if im saying right thing then that sort of makes me get nervous around them then when i start to feel nervous i get some stomach pains i really would prefer just to stop talking stop meeting then i get you know little red blush as well whenever we have meetings \\s therapist: do you ever have desire to leave like if youre in group just to kind of exterior \\s patient: oh yeah all time um i try not to because i dont want to do bad job i dont you know i dont want to perform poorly but sometimes anxiety just takes over little bit i just would prefer to go back to my office be by myself \\s therapist: how distressing this for you i mean obviously youre here so it must be some level of distress but how disruptive it to your functioning \\s patient: why would say im you know when i drive into work you know like its i feel anxious every day ive really just been thinking about leaving my job finding something else where i can potentially even be more secluded not have to go to meetings frequently or make presentations or anything like that \\s therapist: so meetings presentations in particular trigger \\s patient: i was saying yeah i would say so anything where lot of people are looking at me more than few i guess you could say \\s therapist: can you tell me little bit more about physical symptoms you mentioned your stomach hurt when you feel anxious there any other any other symptoms going on you could feel physically \\s patient: um well sometimes my palms will get sweaty my face will get red or ill get overheated but mostly its just some stomach pains leading up to you know throughout day like if im thinking about what i have to do that makes me anxious ill start to get some stomach pains \\s therapist: so when these anxiety episodes are more intense like when you when your stomach hurts you have other symptoms are you worried about it happening again like are you worried that those symptoms are gonna occur again that makes you have more symptoms \\s patient: im not always worried about it happening again i mean sometimes i can anticipate it happening i would like to avoid it but i would say here there i would worry about getting stomach pains or blushing in front of people things like that but its not every time \\s therapist: tell me about meetings that you have you mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected how many people be in typical meeting \\s patient: well its pretty small company but i would say probably anywhere between five 10 most of them are above me though their positions are above me so \\s therapist: so five to 10 how often these meetings scheduled \\s patient: about once or twice week regularly then sometimes we might meet more than that if something needs to be addressed \\s therapist: right so somewhat unplanned \\s patient: mm hmm then some happen weekly okay \\s therapist: so for ones that are planned you get anxious in advanced welcome \\s patient: oh yeah definitely i mean i think about it as soon as i know i always know its coming so im always thinking about you know next meeting that ill have to present at or how ill have to contribute then i just sort of i think about it until it happens then its cycle \\s therapist: all right so meetings triggered generally not being isolated in office kind of triggers this anxiety right but theres other times it sounds like were not anxious when youre isolating office how would have hungry anxious now \\s patient: im not really when im by myself i dont really feel anxious \\s therapist: so really its when you get up for work start thinking about work day especially if theyre meetings right that sort of starts to \\s patient: yeah like if i have off work for couple of days i dont feel anxious at all its really just when im going to work when i know that im going to have to be talking to lot of people or making presentations things like that \\s therapist: so you suffer anxiety advance of these plan meetings how about unplanned meetings whats your experience of those \\s patient: well i mean unplanned meetings i i dont really have lot of time to think about them happening but i would say even when im put on spot have to present anything or just even having long discussion where lot of people are looking at me or you know listening to me for long period of time i would still say i get pretty anxious about that as well \\s therapist: so both really causing say thats really troubling if youre suffering \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: all right what im going to do because im going to schedule you to come see counselor here okay pi b maybe later this week okay thatd be okay thatll work so ill take you out to front well get you scheduled will be treated later on this week \\s patient: okay great \\s therapist: what you told me its been very helpful i want to thank you for coming in \\s patient: thank you",

            "therapist: now one thing i thought we might do today to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious try to see if we can understand more about how you think how you feel when youre in middle of one of those situations so can you think of an example of something thats happened recently \\s patient: my daughter has been shes actually been sick so she had fever yesterday they started her on an antibiotic i had to go pick it up from drugstore thats like i dont usually go there its hard to get there like its not right in neighborhood so any expressways or bridges to get there not expressways but its busy its busier attracting mall so you know there are six lanes four lanes yeah so it just its not someplace i usually would go if i was going to go usually i would either have her go with me or my husband go with me but she was sick he was at work \\s therapist: so to try to understand what goes through your mind thats trying to take you back now you know that prescriptions there your daughters sick i guess you dont want to ask her to drive over there i sorted yeah probably not wisest idea so youre thinking about doing drive whats going through your mind what are thoughts that are turning inside \\s patient: im just you know im sort of thinking about going there im already starting to think well you know what what if you know what if what if im driving somebody crashes into me what if im driving i cant do it you know what if i just have to stop because i cant do it anymore you know it was raining im sort of like ive got this picture of myself like out in middle of road you know whats picture look like youre out in middle of road stranded its dark my you know you know my shoes are gone im just like its like i it would be million miles to get back home pretty miserable \\s therapist: yeah yeah pretty scary \\s patient: oh terrifying yeah i just its so hard to get there \\s therapist: kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation have those thoughts going through your mind what kinds of feelings go along with it \\s patient: my feelings i mean it things are inside like ago anxiety physical things are going on well fear anxiety i just feel really shaky i feel really like lightheaded dizzy i just dont feel like i can breathe very well \\s therapist: its just panic attack now he told me about having some bad ones \\s patient: but its getting there not quite to panic \\s therapist: yeah no its brewing \\s patient: yeah okay yeah it feels like it might yeah \\s therapist: yeah what do you think we might do to try to to move things along toward getting plan of attack on this okay to actually sketch this out okay then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you better handle on that you have right now okay so lets put some boxes here one of them going to be event these are things that trigger your anxiety in this case event was \\s patient: driver having to drive to to pharmacy \\s therapist: drive to pharmacy then this next box im gonna label something we call automatic thoughts but automatic i mean that they occur relatively automatically they just sort of pop into your mind you dont stop to check them out okay we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts you dont have them everybody i know has them their inner thoughts in fact if you think about it for minute we probably have lot more thoughts we dont speak out loud that are part of our inner dialogue thoughts we actually end up speaking aloud other people mm hmm i suspect that you have lots of those thoughts just give me some examples of them so thats what we call an automatic \\s patient: so like what ifs \\s therapist: yeah so lets put couple of those down in this box okay in automatic slot box they are what if \\s patient: someone runs into me \\s therapist: yeah what if what else \\s patient: what if i get stranded \\s therapist: get stranded \\s patient: i cant do it \\s therapist: i cant do it then there was this image about rainstorm you dont have any shoes on yeah so forth what should we put down for that \\s patient: i think what if i would if i cant get back home i cant get back on \\s therapist: sort of lost yeah \\s patient: yeah what if i end up on this road forever \\s therapist: mm hmm then were going to put another box theres sort of chain of events here event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety so if youre thinking like this it makes sense that youd be feeling pretty nervous inside you might have some of these physical reactions mm hmm so lets put those in here this emotion sparks they are much shaky you said yeah quite fear yeah if were going to write that fear on zero to 100 scale zeros none at all 100 maximum anyone could ever get where would you be at this point \\s patient: oh id say about an ad \\s therapist: ad pretty high yeah its gotten higher though i suspect oh yeah this point in 18 okay then you had some other feelings inside \\s patient: well i yeah i sort of felt like i might fall over i my heart was pounding i didnt feel like i can \\s therapist: breathe stomach any lobster so yeah so lot going on here yeah pretty high level of distress yes right then were going to complete this loop putting box were gonna call behavior this how you actually acted when youre in situation so what did you do if you had these thoughts you had these feelings \\s patient: i went to pharmacy he did do it i had to okay \\s therapist: what was it like for you when you were going to pharmacy driving there \\s patient: it was so bad i just you know i i think i left permanent marks on steering wheel because i was whole time \\s therapist: okay yeah so in this case she actually did go to pharmacy that year maybe it isnt damage to steering wheels yeah yeah i hope not \\s patient: but i really had no choice i mean i think usually i wouldnt go to pharmacy usually i would call my husband say can you pick it up on your way home get \\s therapist: an escape route if you would so usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as model for many of these situations about driving feeling yes usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it okay so if you do avoid it then what happens \\s patient: well i feel better you feel better its like such relief \\s therapist: better relief emotions calm down now right \\s patient: well yeah cuz i dont have to like \\s therapist: you dont have to worry about it so thats what happens for single episode of this anxiety im wondering though if we look at impact on you of avoiding getting relief overall as far as managing driving what do you think it does there \\s patient: well i feel like i dont really have much confidence when it comes to this to be able to do \\s therapist: it okay so in way it decreases your confidence over time i think so yeah i think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things whats that belief yeah \\s patient: i dont feel like i can do i cant i cant do it \\s therapist: i cant do it so it really comes back to this thought i cant do it yeah he cant do it you dont do it right so heres this this chain of events events trigger thoughts we call them automatic thoughts then they influence your emotions hes feelings you have then that influences how you handle situation mm hmm okay now lets think together for moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this so lets take look at these thoughts do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you yeah okay i mean an example \\s patient: i mean i think almost everybody i think most people drive without too much problem but like my sister loves to drive yeah i mean she just she drives every opportunity she gets \\s therapist: so for some reason we dont know exactly why but key thing here not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this but you do have some differences in way you think about driving that might be something that we could begin to work on in our session we might for example check it out whats chances of someone slamming into you okay whats chances of you being stranded out there on highway even if you were stranded there way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home so these are some things that we can begin to do so im going to mark here we could work on these thoughts okay then by working on thoughts we might be able to help you reduce emotions but there are also some things that i might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations so well have some try to build some skills to manage your emotions then on this behavior side one thing that we might begin to work on helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up again build your skills to do it i can see that that causes little bit of edginess here what would you think \\s patient: i was thinking that i hope that this doesnt like make me worse okay no like trying to do some of these things \\s therapist: well im glad you gave me that feedback thats an example by way of me wanting to hear from you about way youre responding to what im saying i certainly wouldnt want to make it worse okay but it cause you too much anxiety uh huh what well try to do pace it adjust to level thats right for you okay so that you can make some progress get to place you want to be which to be able to drive to your new office cross bridge maybe even you know drive those couple hours to visit your son right yeah so what do you think \\s patient: well i think that that would if i could do those things that would be really nice yeah \\s therapist: that could be really nice too so that would be our goal yeah",
            "The patient feels anxious for instance when they had to go to drug store to buy medicines for their daughter. The patient experiences anxiety, fear and almost feels like having panic attack. The patient enacts the previous scenario and fears what if they get stranded, lost the way back home or end up at that road forever. These cause high levels of distress for the patient. The patient agrees if they stop driving, their confidence levels will drop so that is not the solution. The therapist mentions these are automatic thoughts, and suggests to work on developing few skills to overcome the fearful thoughts. The therapist envisions the patient will be able to drive to their new office, cross a bridge or drive a couple hours to meet their son. The patient feels very nice about it. "
