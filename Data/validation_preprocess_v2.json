            "therapist: hi kyle how have you been ? patient: i not too good man . therapist: not too good ? patient: yeah . so something happened over this past week i wa i wa driving to my buddy house and i forgot that my tag for my car is expired earlier this month . so i got pulled over for that and then i do know why i did this but the cop asked to search my car and i wa like yeah that fine like whatever because he said he had two search . this is getting towed . and i completely forgot that i had my junk bag in the trunk . so we opened the trunk and he wa looking through the bag . so he found me he found everything . i had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my piece . so i got a i got in trouble for possession . so i just i just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision . he said that i could either do two week of community service like about hour or i could pay fine . and i trying to i really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better i guess the both kind of suck but therapist: so you struggling with the decision between two option you perceived a negative right . patient: right . therapist: now we discussed the marijuana usage before wa just probably the root of this problem . right ? patient: right . therapist: but it sound like you did really want to explore change this time . patient: no i mean it it really not a problem like it just they do really want it problem is that i got caught like i doing good in school work fine . so obviously like marijuana is other than just going to court it ha never been a problem . therapist: so let focus on this decision then . patient: right therapist: so the decision is between a couple week of community service what kind of community service ? patient: just picking up crap inside of the road ? therapist: or fine ? patient: yeah . therapist: and do you have the thousand dollar ? patient: i do but i have i got a vacation coming up and i definitely like i want to i want to keep the money for like a little little vacation we like do some some fun stuff with my buddy . definitely like i want to keep that money . but i mean i also like the community service is like also kind of close to the vacation so i might have to like give up part of the vacation or to to do the two week so that i think that did really help my decision either . therapist: do you see any value in either one of these option which is all become negative ? patient: i mean really like they both they both have the same negative i guess like like if i if i do the community service that i like you know i do get to keep the money . but i mean other hand like if i keep the money i doing community service like i not gon na have all the time to spend the money . so it now i mean neither really have a positive and both the negative are kind of equal to so it it kind of tough to choose . therapist: so let talk about what important to try to help you make this decision . really what you going to have to determine is and what i want to explore is the importance of keeping the money . right because that really what this come down to . patient: right . therapist: you you keep it and you do the service or you spend it and you do do the service ? patient: right therapist: so you could you could say that it about the importance of keeping the money rr you could say it about the importance of avoiding the community service . patient: right . therapist: so let talk a little about that . what how would you say on a scale of one to where is very important . how would you scale keeping the money ? patient: i mean that obviously pretty high . like i guess keeping the money it be like a nine . because if i like if i if i keep the money obviously i can like use it for other other thing . i say probably nine . therapist: so keeping in mind that that very important to you . patient: right . therapist: so that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service . patient: right . yeah i mean i guess that true . like i did think about it in that way like if i if i give up the the two week of time like obviously that would suck but like i have i guess i have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time . you know so i guess i could think about it that way maybe therapist: well let look at the other side too . how important is it for you on a scale of one to to avoid the community service ? so we know it a nine right to keep the money ? patient: right . therapist: how to avoid the community service ? patient: maybe like i guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service i mean it would be that bad . obviously like it would be a waste of time . we gon na have to do this crap work for for so long but i do know . like at least i know if i do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time . you know so i can i can always keep that in mind . therapist: so a you talking it seems like you leaning toward or maybe you leaning toward completing the service . even though you not happy with either choice right ? patient: right therapist: that might be the least objectionable . patient: yeah yeah . yeah i guess cuz i never like i never thought about scaling it like that way . so yeah i think so . therapist: when do you have to make this decision by ? patient: by the end of the week so today tuesday so i have like a couple of day to think it over . therapist: and you go back before the judge on friday patient: on friday yeah . when i get the decision . therapist: once you weigh some of the factor with the way this importance of the money versus doing the community service patient: right therapist: let meet again just before maybe on thursday . okay let meet again thursday . and just talk about it and take a look at your decision making process and making sure that you made a decision that you can be most happy with . i know neither option is happy option for you . patient: right therapist: they one that the least destructive for you the least negative for you patient: right therapist: that sound like a plan . ? patient: all right . yeah i think i can do that . yeah give me some more . therapist: good then i see there . patient: yep sound good . therapist: take care .",
            "patient had a problem in the past week . patient got pulled over by a cop for expired tag . cop searched the car and found weed . patient went under possession the sent to the court and charged a fine or community service of hour . patient wa confused between selecting either of the option . therapist got to know that marijuana is the root of this problem . patient wa doing school work fine so patient thought that marijuana is just a thing that made to go to court . therapist asked to patient choose either of the option between a fine or community service of hr . therapist asked to scale both option from to . patient wa planning for a vacation but patient wa ready give week for community service . then the patient scaled money out and community service out of . therapist asked to take a decision by the end of the week and choose the right option for you ."

patient: they have said much . i wa really scared to tell them actually because i knew they just be so disappointed and disinterest by the fact that i did fail . yeah i never failed anything before . and so yes . really hard . therapist: yeah . so it new and you do like it at all ? patient: not at all . i think leaving uni will just be the way out just so i do have to go through it again . therapist: okay well i glad you come to counseling because it good for u to get an outsider opinion when we got so much on our plate and we confused a to what to do and our emotion can get in the way . and you just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff on your plate at the moment . okay . so i glad you come here . here with the clinic we use the abc model which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model . so marsha some counselor have put together a list of belief that we often use . and we do realize that we using those belief and they tend to be faulty one . here the least here . have a look through that to see if there are any belief that you might be operating on at the moment . patient: i think number two therapist: okay . read that one out for me patient: that it necessary to have a high degree of uncertainty in order to be happy and perform well . therapist: yeah . you mentioned that patient: number that it necessary to be competent and successful in all those thing which are attempted . therapist: hmm yeah that an expectation from your family . patient: yeah . possibly number eight . that loss should be entirely pleasant ending and enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable . therapist: hmm . yeah . which one of those stand out the most for you at the moment ? patient: umm probabily number . yeah . therapist: how would you put that in your own word ? patient: that i need to be successful all the time andeverything that i do . therapist: hmm . patient: yeah . therapist: and is that different from what happening in your life at the moment ? patient: well failing that exam i mean i wa successful with that . so yeah it just throw out i guess even number two because throw that all the order in my life . i need to have everything . i need to know what i doing where i going . yes . therapist: okay so if number four is an expectation that your family ha given that you have of yourself how do you measure up next to number four ? patient: i do feel like i good enough . therapist: okay . all right . well what i like to do is is put some of those idea on the board under the abc . and i explain a we go along . patient: okay . therapist: okay . so what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment ? patient: i mean there are a lot of thing but i think obviously filing the exam wa the main one . therapist: all right . and and the consequence you thinking of leaving uni . and and that statement you made earlier about ? yeah that that the one . that the crucial one and i explain it shortly when i get up to the board . patient: okay . therapist: okay i think i put it up there now for you so we can work through that . so marsha the activating event which is what you stated earlier and the kind of decision that you thinking about is patient: leaving uni ? therapist: that right okay . so it important that we consider the jump from here over to here . and the kind of thinking that you been swirling around in your head affect the consequence . and you mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit . and you put that in your own word . what are your word before ? patient: that i not good enough . therapist: it really important for u to consider that kind of thinking hmm . okay marsha it good that we got those thing on the board . and what i like to do now is focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking looking at it from another point of view . to me it sound like you you doing a whole lot of thing really well . can you list all of the thing that you doing really well ? patient: i working it a really demanding job you know keeping up with it . i guess . thing that my fiance i mean we engaged . so planning the wedding that going really well . it stressful but it going well . therapist: and all of you other university subject ? patient: yeah . never sold anything before . this is the first time i guess all the other subject ? yeah yeah . therapist: and you succeeding in all of those thing together ? patient: yeah . therapist: you juggling it . and it a lot on your plate at the moment . but it sound like you been able to cope up until this point of the one exam . patient: yeah . this one just threw me off balance . just failing . therapist: so would you describe yourself a successful most of the time ? patient: yeah most of the time therapist: yeah . and what the evidence for that ? patient: passing all my fan all the time . i just passing my subject not getting that full time job . it a great job that i doing . i getting married . therapist: yeah that right . yeah . so how do all of those success compared to that belief that you written that i written on the board for you ? patient: i guess in comparison i am good enough . therapist: yeah that right . yeah . and all the evidence is there . all of the subject that you passed in first year and now second year . year round full time job . that a success . yeah it great . yeah . good . okay . well what i like to do is get you to write that on the board to dispute that belief . okay . yeah . would you do that ? patient: alright therapist: well done last that a powerful statement . what kind of decision go along with that ? patient: staying at uni . therapist: good . okay . knock that on the board first . patient: okay therapist: alright that good . good . okay . so you made a bit of a decision have you ? patient: yeah . therapist: okay . tell me about it . doe it feel like okay ? patient: yeah . i feel like i should stay . therapist: okay . why is that ? patient: i can try again . everything doe have to be all the time . good . good . yeah i mean i could reset the exam . therapist: okay yeah . yeah . and we talked about all your success . yeah . so it hard now to believe that top statement that i not good enough . patient: yeah i mean i am good enough compared to all the thing that you helped me realize with all the success that i had that i am good enough . yeah . good . therapist: okay . and so this idea about staying at uni . patient: yeah i will stay . i am good enough . so i sure i can give it another go and see how it go from there . i can reset the exam and i sure i be fine . therapist: okay good . okay . what i like you to do is to keep saying that statement . i am good enough to say it in front of the mirror two or three time a day so that you build up your confidence because it going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief . and we tend to carry those other belief for year and year and year . and so it going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system . but you made a great start here today . so congratulation . patient: thank you",

            "therapist: hi olive . patient: hi therapist: welcome back . patient: thank you . therapist: how are you ? patient: feeling pretty intense . thing have kind of gone downhill since i wa here last time . therapist: ohh i sorry to hear that . patient: yeah . therapist: i know last time we talked you and kalie had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plan that you had for your life . so so tell me what ha happened what what is what shifted ? patient: i think that we just sort of fallen back . you know i wa really hopeful that and with the proposal also came the promise to you know work on the relationship and work on anger and work on you know being the couple that we we hope to be and that it not happening it not happening . we right back to where we were . therapist: i sorry to hear that . i know you were . you were excited . you were feeling hopeful for change . and i do get that same sense from you right now . in fact it seems like you feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about that situation . well how can i make how can i be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now . patient: i just i do i do know how to make change . i do know how to i do know how to end this . i do know how to get out . i do know how to . i just i ca do it anymore . therapist: so you decided to make a change . and in fact it sound like you decided to leave the relationship . patient: i do know . i mean i want to i do want to be in it . but i do i do know how to get to not being in it . therapist: so you thinking about it . it not that you committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship . but correct me if i wrong . what you saying is you want to make a change and you do want this relationship a it is . patient: yeah . therapist: now what what are you when you think about changing ? what what idea ? i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibility or thought have you had about change and what that might look like ? patient: i do know . it just feel so overwhelming when i think about it . i just i ca seem to find a way out of it . and that feel feel ethical . it feel like it can no i do want to hurt her . i just do want to be in this relationship anymore . therapist: why do you want to be in this relationship anymore ? patient: it not healthy . it i not happy . i ca imagine that she happy even though she say she is . it you know we fighting constantly . i feel like i walking on eggshell with her . she overprotective . she just it doe feel right . just doe feel right . therapist: it doe feel right . so what would feel right ? patient: ah that a huge question . i just do i not sure just this is right . therapist: so the way thing are is not right . it not working you do feel supported . this is the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be . patient: yeah . i mean when we started it wa it wa lovely . she wa amazing . she wa this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know we are lot of same interest you know same friend it you know she wa just fantastic . and i do know i do know where that changed . and i feel like we did this on again off again stuff and it just it just seems like just not right . and i know i know i do deserve to be treated this way . and i know that i i better than that . therapist: you really value your self and your well being and in your spirit . and it sound like you do feel like you taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though thing started out well they have turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself patient: no but you know but she lovely and i love her and i ca imagine . i ca imagine my life without her in it . therapist: so you feeling torned ? patient: yeah therapist: you you torned between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself and you got a lot of mixed feeling . and you are saying that you need something to change that sound like you able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that you got these strong feeling for this person and you do feel like this is the good relationship for you . patient: no . i think it not good for either one of u . therapist: for both of you . yeah . so so then you talked a little bit about leaving . i mean tell me more about what you thought about . and when you think about making a change in term of leaving what what might that look like for you ? patient: i do know . i mean it feel . i just ca imagine my life without her in it . so the idea of not having her there feel really scary . and the idea of staying the way it is and thing not changing feel even scarier . so i do i do know how to and i do even know how i would do that . our life are so intertwined . i mean my business our friend the queer community is so small you know that my family a much a my friend and my family a well . and so just you know how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way for me like in a way that i feel i doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself . therapist: what what thought do you have about how you do that ? how do you extract yourself ? how might you extract yourself in a way that ha some integrity and grace a you said patient: i do i do even know . i mean talk to my friend jay about it and i do know he suggested like a break but i do i do know . i just do want to get caught in that on again off again before like you know like we done before and but the idea of a break . feel a little le . i do know maybe more gentle . i do know therapist: say more a little more gentle . patient: i do know how to give u both time to really think about it and and i do know maybe maybe she change maybe maybe if i you know if this is it if this is it like if this break is it maybe maybe she be able to change . therapist: i heard you say that . live it you know moving on and having a life without kelly is really scary . in fact it almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with the way that your life are so intertwined . i also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier . and i wa wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that . patient: it just i feel exhausted . i feel like i not . i not who i wa . when i came into this relationship . i feel like i constantly struggling to make her happy and that just doe work . there nothing i can do . and i feel like i lost my joy . and i do know . i just afraid of what will happen if i just keep staying in a place where i feel like i falling apart . hmm my piece . therapist: yeah . so you concerned about your own well being and your own joy and your your spirit if you you stay and do make this change and that the part that really scary for you . patient: yeah . therapist: you mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break . and you said that that wa a scary thought for you . and i guess i like to hear more additional thought you might have about that a a a an option for you . patient: well it seems like i mean if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what i want and what i need and and you know i feel like i ca sort out what me in this anymore . and and so like if i have that space just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feeling and taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while . i do know it seems like that would be helpful . therapist: it sound like you feeling like you so in in it just so in the the mixed emotion and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it really hard for you to see out of it . and an advantage reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing . patient: yeah . therapist: well if you do mind i love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here . i just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on a scale of zero to zero being not motivated at all and being extremely motivated . how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now ? patient: oh six so somewhat motivated . therapist: why a six and not a one ? patient: because i need i need it . i feel like i losing myself . so i feel like therapist: it important ? patient: yeah . therapist: well so so why a six and not a nine ? or ? patient: cuz i not sure how to make it happen . yeah i do i do know . therapist: so it important to you and you not maybe fully confident or sure about the how part . patient: yeah therapist: how to make it happen ? patient: exactly . therapist: well kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to zero being not confident at all . being extremely confident . how confident are you that if you decided to take a break from your relationship with kelly you would be successful at making that happen ? patient: i do know maybe like a three or four . therapist: so so le confident or le confident than you are motivated . why a three not a zero . patient: because i i on it . i mean i do something i want . therapist: mm hmm . and so wanting it make you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen . patient: yeah yeah . therapist: why three and not an eight or nine ? patient: i ca control her . i do know how she would react and i just do want any more argument and anger . and yeah i do want to hurt her . so . therapist: so when you think about taking this break you also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do and that creates this whole other kind of set of worry . it it undermines your sense of confidence onon some level . patient: it creates a lot of anxiety for me . therapist: yeah . what do you think need to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break . patient: i think i like maybe a plan like just knowing knowing what the rule are sort of like where where i want to go with it . and when i home i do know what i want to accomplish . therapist: so thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what the boundary are might might help you . patient: yeah regard . therapist: okay . and then one final question on a scale of zero to . zero being not ready at all . and being extremely ready . how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break in the let say the next couple of week . patient: i think an eight therapist: so pretty ready ? patient: yeah . therapist: and and you spoken to this already a little bit i believe but i ask you again why an eight and not a one or two ? patient: because i know if i just let it drag out that i going to be miserable . therapist: so your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself . and if you do thing are not going to get any better . and that that make you both motivated and even more ready . well why why an eight and not a ten ? patient: that you know scary . change is hard and thinking about not being the woman i thought i wa gon na marry that make me sad . therapist: so your emotion your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way patient: sort of giving up on a dream . therapist: yeah and so another aspect to that to your whole experience say that you you grieving . the relationship is even over yet but you grieving the dream and the hope that you had . and that a that a heaviness and certainly a factor and in what you do next ? patient: yeah therapist: well if i could take just a moment and make sure i captured and understood everything you shared with me and i i know this is really difficult to talk about . so i really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this ha been like for you . you been feeling stuck . and thing were great for a while you had some hope that thing were going to change and now you are realizing that kelly not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspiration and your dream in a lot of different regard . you know that you need to make a change you want to make a change and you have a lot of mixed feeling about this change . you know it what you want to do it the right thing for you . and you still really care and love kelly . and you also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family and your friend and how they may be affected by a breakup . in order to make this more manageable you thinking maybe in term of smaller change like taking a small break a opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you pretty ready . you somewhat you know you motivated . and then maybe a little le confident . but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident . patient: yeah . therapist: and that certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that alright with you . i be happy to hear your idea maybe even share some suggestion with you about a possible plan . patient: that be great . therapist: is that alright ? patient: yeah . thank you . therapist: thank you very much for your time . i really appreciate it .",

            "therapist: let how are you ? patient: good . therapist: it good to see you . yeah . therapist: again the year bench record this week is the last last week . it wa like kind of squeaky clean . so how it been feeling ? i sure it doe . it really doe . yeah . it been really a process . so that fantastic . what ? tell me about what been going on this week ? patient: i had a good conversation . patient: yes i feel good . therapist: tell me about it . patient: i just talked with her on the phone . and yeah it just went really well . and we actually after that we had a skype meeting a skype meeting last night . yes it wa . and yeah caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some thing . therapist: great . yeah . oh nice . nice . happy to hear about that . and then i do remember i trying to think from last time like any allen update or yeah nice thing going okay good . i happy to hear that . and then i guess the other thing that i wanted to you know talk with you about i know that we you know kind of had mentioned it briefly . but today kind of mark the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for u like so then over the next you know three session we going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together . and i been feeling that way too because it like it hard to it hard to want to bring that up because it really it been really just great working with you . and so i really do want to see that come to an end . but i thought one of the thing that really important is maybe just to get u starting to talk about and again we do have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about you know some of the change that you made thing that have gone really well for you . and really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you not at all and kind of maybe we can kind of talk about how that gone . because i think the other thing that really important is not only the thing that you done in term of like how thing have gotten better for you but i also want u to start thinking about to like okay what going to happen when we you know kind of get to the end of our work together and you know beyond so like in term of like how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going . and so i kind of thought you know like i feel like i kind of being like a wet blanket here . you had a really great week and now i bringing up our kind of departure . but i think it really important to kind of mark that mark that transition and also to market to by having you know thing go so well . i think it really important . so i guess the first thing i want to talk about is i guess i pointing my my pad of paper because it like it so filled with just all the different thing that have occurred for you you know over the last several week and i think the first thing that really notable to me is i really really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because i know that that been so hard for you . and it been so painful you know the way that she treated you in the past . but that you know i guess i even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich the transition you made in term of the way you engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that been you know really vital to your you know like getting better . so what what you know in term of like from your perspective kind of what that been like for you ? patient: yeah . it kind of emotionally and it feel good . patient: it nice not butting head with her cuz therapist: i sure like patient: you want like i want a good relationship with my mom . i do i do choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her . yeah it feel really good . i feel like i can have better relationship other place a well now because that healthy . therapist: right . right money . and also to i think along with that is that kind of the strategy i think that you you know my hunch would be is that some of the strategy that you used engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respect in term of like some of the other relationship that you had you know especially i know that you and kathy have gotten closer and even the fact that you allowed yourself to kind of you know connect with somebody else like you know with alan you know i know you were talking with me the other day about some other friend that you you know met and people that you really got a little bit closer to so that been really exciting . yeah patient: yeah . yeah . just get to not go home and feel terrible . right . therapist: yeah . yeah . so then then kind of from from your perspective again you know we talk more about this in you know a you mean i realize i kind of putting you on the spot but a you kind of thought about or thinking about it . maybe you can think about it . to even from now on to the next couple of session but just starting to think about like what is it that you really done that you really feel like ha been really that really helped you make change in the way in which you you know managed your food or your binge eating . patient: i mean just really trying to be more positive in my relationship and being more open and communicating not keeping thing in sofia like when i kept thing in it kind of bubble up . and that what made me want to do something that made me feel better . and i yeah i mean like something bother me like immediately express it therapist: bro . no i noticed that a well . and it seems like that that been one of the important thing that you done . it really helped you know with the change that you made . what else feel like that ? i mean you know i mean obviously that been really important but what are the other thing that you noticed in term of like you know how it been going patient: i feel better about myself . and like not having comment from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really like how i love . yeah . and yeah just yet feeling happier with myself . therapist: grade are good . no you know thing like like we really in a good space . and i think the other thing too i wa aware of that we you know that you mentioned to me in particular last time wa that and i did get a chance to talk with you a much about it . so i think we had so much to talk about last session but i wa really struck by the fact that you it seems like you have been a body conscious a you have been in the past . and i did know if you if you noticed that . patient: yeah no i feel like i known like a little bit . notice that yeah . especially that you bring it up . it true therapist: right ? yeah . cuz i know like initially and even like there have been time even along the way . when you make like you know i did feel like it looked very good or i felt like something felt really tight on me or you know i just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me but it seems like that that a we kind of moved along that there really been i really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you kind of been regarding yourself . and it seems like it been a little bit different patient: in that hearing like any comment all my mom about any of that stuff right . i feel like i gotten to the point where i not concerned like that . i going to hear a comment . right . therapist: okay but so i going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway . but what did you do in order to be able to get those comment though to stop ? because obviously i think you did something really significant with her . yes . patient: i mean i thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and justin lee and i know i wa able to let her know that and is hired scared to tell her that i mean she recognized that . yeah . and yeah she kind of explained how she thought that she wa helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friend in high school . and that what she i mean she kind of said like her mom said the same thing to her . therapist: yeah yeah . well you know and that really not uncommon when you have you know it funny that just even like not you know like big big research had but it seems like that that pretty consistent that you know kind of like you know mother to daughter who become mother to daughter like sometimes it kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like you know kind of criticality about you know shape and weight and and you know some you know really proud of you that you you know kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because you know i think you know a a parent i know that you owe it like you know i always want to try to do the right thing you know and i always you know i do purposely want to inflict pain on my child even though my daughter would suggest that i probably do . but in general i do . that not my goal is to be you know harsh and critical . in fact i really wa you know try to really be helpful . and i think most parent try to do the right thing . but i and i think maybe your mom just did realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt . and in many respect how much that kind of really drove you to you know really you know take it out on yourself so to speak . and so for you to have the courage to bring that up i think wa really helpful . yeah yeah . so i really think that that made a lot of difference a well a you know kind of reaching out to others and again in just the open expression of your feeling so yeah . so yeah i think the thing that we doing like now i think i really like to see u kind of continue to you know obviously you still are doing a lot of really good work in term of like the thing that you talking about and but yet i also aware that you know a we over the next couple session we kind of keep doing a few of these thing kind of wrapping up . and then our last session we can more or le kind of formally you know say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next step are and you know some thing you might want to be paying attention to or thing you might want to you know be mindful of but we get there so yeah . patient: great . thankyou",
            "the therapist recount how the patient ha successfuly overcome binge eating and discus the patient willingness to engage with mom despite their ill treatment . the patient ha been trying to keep their relationship positive by being open and more communicative with sophia . the patient feel better about themselves to have someone to love them and their grade have been good . the patient mom ha been critical about the patient regarding shape weight and other thing a an intergenerational transmission . the patient ha progressed greatly by communicating this with their mom and seeking help from others . the therapist asks to continue discussing these thing more in the next couple session and probably wrap up ."

            "therapist: hi kylie . how you doing today ? patient: umm i doing okay i guess . umm i guess something happened over this past week . i have been looking for a new job since i left my last one . and i found i found this really good job on the internet . but the problem is that the job is working with kid and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job . and it kinda like it made me think it made me think a little bit more about something that i been considering for a while which is kind of just given up given up we forget like it i thinking about it for a while . but okay i also kind of think about the way the way we really help me and like if i ever feeling like really really anxious about something i mean we kind of have to chill out and hope to relax and i just do know if i ready to give that up yet . therapist: so the marijuana ha real value for you that you do want to see going . patient: yeah it doe . it a it a good way to self medicate in a way therapist: and at the same time you would like this job . patient: yeah . therapist: so i could see how this would be you know a pincher . patient: right . yeah it i mean it kind of like it put me in a difficult spot like i definitely i definitely want to get that job but you know if i cut it if i cut out smoking like i do know what else i would do like if i if i started to have a panic attack or if if i wa really like anxious about like anything that i worrying about like i do i do know what i did cope . therapist: have you been treated for anxiety before ? patient: um i did therapy for a little bit but it wa like i do know back then it wa kind of like when the anxiety wa just starting so it wa too big of a problem . so i like i quit there because it wa really doing that much . yeah . therapist: you take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety . patient: i mean like if i bored or maybe if i like hanging out with buddy like i do really have a reason not to do it . i can tell now but it wa like like i really use it whenever i like feeling really anxious about something . therapist: so and you may not be able to answer this question but if you did have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana ? patient: if i did have like any kind of anxiety ? therapist: hmm patient: umm like it wa so be kind of tough to give up . because like if i hanging out with my buddy and they offer it to me like that that always pretty chill but i do like i really i really looking forward to this job and like the benefit of having that job without weighing the benefit of just like smoking smoking with my buddy so therapist: so you excited about the job ? patient: i am ? yeah it it almost kind of a dream job . therapist: really tell me about ? patient: well it working with it working with kid with autism in the school . so like i would be kind of like almost like a personal ta in a way . so like it part of an inclusion program . so when the kid are going into the class like i would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something come up . and it just my brother ha autism that like it that something that i always really kind of wanted to work with . therapist: so it sound like your real passion for this type of work . patient: hmm therapist: and really the big obstacle here is this marijuana ? patient: it is it like a catch because it like i know the job will be great but it like it a it a big step for me to take that job . and it it gon na be super umm it gon na make me super anxious . you know it gon na be like it gon na be a lot of anxiety taking a new job . so it like if i have to give up the marijuana and then like not have another way to cope with anxiety like to get the job . it like a catch therapist: yeah it a predicament . you kind of weighing both side of this right . now . i wondering . do you have do you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana ? patient: no i mean not really no . therapist: so you really using it recreationally and a an anti anxiety agent ? patient: yeah . yeah pretty much . therapist: so if you were i know you did have great success before therapy to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which seems like you would really like do you think you be able to stay with the marijuana ? patient: i think if the therapy really worked i would be able to like it just so easy now just to kind of light up . like that an easy fix . and like i do think therapy is going to be that instant . so like it would it would be tough . i think if i had real confidence that the therapy would work i could do it . but i mean it wa i have to it would definitely have to work like i just a well a a smoking . therapist: you would need to see result ? patient: yeah yeah definitely therapist: would having the job that you passionate about reduce your anxiety ? patient: after a while like after i got used to this job but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious . and then like it would be tough not not to smoke or doing that . like i do i do want to get on a drug test anymore because like it it being decriminalized being legalized so many place and there so much research saying that it not that bad . it kind of like it really upsetting that the place that i really want to work sa that policy i think it really silly . therapist: you frustrated . marijuana is illegal . patient: yeah it yeah . therapist: at the same time it the reality you living in . patient: right . . yeah it either they will be legalized in like in the state in a couple of year . but until then like i mean i ca wait that long to start start working so therapist: until then you still need to address this dilemma ? patient: right ? yeah it still a problem . therapist: so you have choice here right . you can continue to use the marijuana and not take the job . patient: hmm . therapist: and that seems like something that ha some advantage for you but some some disadvantage right ? patient: right therapist: because you would really like that job . patient: yeah . and i would it it sound so pathetic to be like no i do want to take my dream job because i need weed like sound really stupid . therapist: so where do you think you are in term of making this change ? do you feel motivated to take some step toward it ? patient: i do like i i still kind of on the fence because like if i if i have to give it up for the job i could do that . but i would definitely need like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety . like whether it therapy or whether it like something else i yeah i would i would definitely need like a substitute if i got rid of it for good . therapist: so you definitely definitely need it ? patient: yeah therapist: so you ca give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety ? patient: right . therapist: that that key to you to make this change . patient: yeah . yeah definitely . therapist: but at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job . patient: right ? yeah . i mean i mean if i really thought that i could like get some kind of treatment that wa a good a weed . yeah i mean i could maybe quit especially the house to get the job especially . therapist: so with anxiety reduction your chance of stopping marijuana increase and then you could take the job that you want patient: yeah yeah i mean that would be the best the best outcome . therapist: is that the outcome you would most want ? patient: yeah i think so . i think i could give up record like doing it with my buddy recreationally . i could yeah i just going to have a cigarette . therapist: so here what i thinking . and let me know what you think about this . when you come back next week right ? what if we start looking at this anxiety ? when we start you know i start treating anxiety . we see if we can get it reduced . and kind of work from there . because maybe when you start to feel if that work and that anxiety start to abate it sound like it just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage . patient: yeah . yeah . therapist: what kind of timeframe are you on in term of taking this job ? patient: i mean the job . it ha a high turnover rate so like even if i think i need to apply this week but if i do get in more than likely another position like it will open up like within a month or two . therapist: and when would they drug test you ? patient: it would be like oh all right after i apply so i applied and then did the interview . that when they will give him the paperwork . and i have to go get drug tested on . therapist: and when did the last time you use marijuana ? patient: just a couple day ago . therapist: to see what i getting that ? patient: yeah yeah it uh yeah . so i like i would be able to do i would be able to make it this application . but i would like to be off it by the next one . therapist: so you fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high patient: right therapist: because it give you an opportunity to apply later on . so do you feel like you can invest in that plan ?

i sure there are situation and diary more or le have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety . patient: you mean how i feeling or what type of situation that happens in ? therapist: well let cover both . let start with what type of situation trigger it patient: okay um i guess whenever i in a big crowd purchase with a bunch of coworkers . if we have meeting or they ask for my input on input on something i tend to get nervous and i just wonder you know if i saying the right thing and then that sort of make me get nervous around them . and then when i start to feel nervous i get some stomach pain . i really would prefer just to stop talking stop the meeting . and then i get you know a little red and blush a well whenever we have meeting . therapist: do you ever have a desire to leave ? like if you in a group just to kind of exterior ? patient: oh yeah all the time . um i try not to because i do want to do a bad job and i do you know i do want to perform poorly . but sometimes the anxiety just take over a little bit and i just would prefer to go back to my office and be by myself . therapist: and how distressing is this for you ?

like are you worried that those symptom are gon na occur again that make you have more symptom ? patient: i not always worried about it happening again . i mean sometimes i can anticipate it happening . and i would like to avoid it . but i would say here and there i would worry about getting the stomach pain or blushing in front of people thing like that but it not every time . therapist: tell me about the meeting that you have . you mentioned that you have meeting you have to go to expected . how many people be in a typical meeting ? patient: well it a pretty small company but i would say probably anywhere between five and . most of them are above me though . their position are above me so therapist: so five to how often these meeting scheduled patient: about once or twice a week regularly and then sometimes we might meet more than that if something need to be addressed . therapist: right so somewhat unplanned . patient: mm hmm . and then some happen weekly . okay . therapist: so for the one that are planned you get anxious in advanced welcome . patient: oh yeah definitely . i mean i think about it a soon a i know i always know it coming . so i always thinking about you know the next meeting that i have to present at or how i have to contribute . and then i just sort of i think about it until it happens and then it a cycle . therapist: all right . so the meeting triggered generally not being isolated in the office kind of trigger this anxiety . right . but there other time it sound like we not anxious when you isolating the office . how would have hungry anxious now ? patient: i not really when i by myself . i do really feel anxious . therapist: so really it when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day especially if they meeting right ? that sort of start to patient: yeah like if i have off work for a couple of day i do feel anxious at all . it really just when i going to work when i know that i going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentation thing like that . therapist: so you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meeting ?

patient: no i have quit . therapist: so deep . do you remember our conversation from our last visit ? that when i give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist . patient: yes i remember . but no i did quit . and no i did call her . therapist: and why is that ? patient: i not ready . and i too upset to talk about this . i do mean to be rude doctor . but i had a hard time lately . and i not in the mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting . i let you know when i ready . we can talk about it . but here now today i here to talk about my blood clot . therapist: well we on the same page then because that exactly why i talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking is a major risk factor for dvt . even if you even if we treat you now if you do quit smoking i afraid the blood clot will return again . patient: let just talk about my treatment right now . okay ? patient: i have really thought about it actually . i thought about canceling this appointment because i knew you going to bring it up again . therapist: talking about smoking with me a hard for you . patient: yes it because you going to tell me to quit like you always do a limit filter just like everyone else . like my caseworker . the building manager everybody seems to they know what i need to do . and nobody think i know anything . therapist: so when it come to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decision for you . you do feel heard or respected ? patient: no respect . that it . yes . therapist: well i just want to say that i am very glad you decided to come in today . so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clot are very serious and i know you concerned . a your provider i have to be honest and say that smoking can cause blood clot . but hopefully some of the information i give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking . now having said that i know my opinion is not the deciding factor . quitting smoking a a decision only you can make . patient: well i really glad i came into i have to get this blood clot condition under control . i know that therapist: would it be okay with you if i share some information about smoking and blood clot . and i can tell you what i know and then we see what you think . patient: yes . i do know that i will quit but i will listen . therapist: so what do you think ? patient: i always thought that the blood clot came from my mother . hello like passed down like genetics . i did know that smoking could cause this . i just thought that blood clot ran in my family . i guess i also did get how dangerous this clotting can be . therapist: you seem surprised and a little more aware now of the smoking risk ? patient: i guess so . yes . therapist: so maria i like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking . so on a scale of one to with one being you do think it is at all important that you quit and being you ready to quit today ? where would you put yourself ? patient: well if you had asked me when i first came in i would have said le than one . but now i would have to say four therapist: why four and not a lower number . patient: that a good question . let me think about it . patient: i guess it a four because of the blood clot . the blood clot are really heavy on my mind right now . therapist: so having a better understanding of how smoking add to the risk of blood clot increase your desire to quit . patient: a little . yes . therapist: what else if anything make quitting important to you ? patient: know the bigger thing for me is the fear of being evicted from my apartment . there a rule that we can smoke in the house . and i stick to it for the most part but the other day i smoked out the window . and that wa only the second time i done it . but do you know the building manager caught me . so now i am sure she going to be watching me even more . i ca lose my part . with therapist: the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upset you in addition to your health patient: i would hate to think that my sogdian they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over abiding by stupid code even if i hate that rule . i smoked when i wa pregnant with them . and thank you holy mother they were born healthy . i do think i could live with myself if they lost their home because of something i doing . therapist: so it sound like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your child . it obvious that you a good mom . and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear . patient: yes they would . therapist: so let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to . how would you rate your confidence to quit ? patient: confidence ? i have to say at two . therapist: so you are not feeling very confident right now patient: who oh no not confident at all . i mean i tried to quit so many time and i just ca do it . therapist: so you been persistent and trying and have been successful yet . still you you set a two and not a one . i curious about that . patient: well the only reason i said are two is that i tried quitting smoking when i wa pregnant with santhi and they are both . i went for two month without a cigarette with dale . and i did make it past that . and that wa really mad at myself for that . i really wanted to quit from my baby and i failed . i guess . i just hopeless . i mean who keep smoking when there a baby inside ? therapist: sound like you really feel like you let yourself and your child down . and that hard to accept given how much you love your kid . patient: yes . and i doing it again right now by not following the rule . i addicted to cigarette just like a drug addict . in the end the cigarette always with . therapist: so what what do you think santa and to think about your smoking ? patient: santhi yell at me . and sometimes they cry when i go out to smoke . he say mama smoking is bad . therapist: so you know it would be best for you and your child if you quit . if you had the right support and tool to manage this addiction . if you believed you could do it you would patient: i would like to do so but i just do think i can do it . therapist: you quit for two month when you were pregnant with tail . therapist: how did you do with them ? patient: i do know . i just did it . i fought the urge with sucking on straw and some hard kelly i just did it . therapist: so you were able to quit on your own for two month . that impressive . have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support group ? patient: no i think people can quit . if they really want to . i just too weak . therapist: ah wow . you must be pretty hard on yourself . what would you say if i told you that very few people only of u are able to quit successfully cold turkey . patient: no there really ? is that true huh ? therapist: yes . and and most people try many time before they successful . their medication and group at and i be happy to share that information with you . i like to help you if that something that you like . patient: well i do know . i let me think about it . can you give me the information again ?

            "therapist: hi kylie how are you doing today ? patient: i pretty good . how are you dr . grande ? therapist: i doing i doing well thanks for asking . what been going on ? patient: um so i i been applying to doctor program for this upcoming fall . and i like i kind of stuck because i got into two of the school that that i wa looking at . i get and like i got into both of them and both of their program are really good . both of them have like great research track record and kind of what i want to do . therapist: right patient: and yeah but the problem is is like i do know how to decide between the two now . therapist: okay so you you applied to two place and you got them both . patient: hmm therapist: it sound like both have program that are really well suited to what you want to do ? patient: right . therapist: and you having difficulty deciding which one to go with . patient: yeah . um yeah like i always i always had trouble like within decisiveness and it like when i when i had two choice of something that very similar like i always i always get stuck . and i like it very hard for me to actually like make a decision therapist: let are start to the beginning . you definitely want to go on for a phd . okay so we established that patient: right . therapist: so it going to be one of these program either way . so really the only question you really left with is which one ? patient: yeah . therapist: so oftentimes these situation we look at pro and con right ? are there any ? well it sound like there a lot of pro to each one . are there any con to the one ? patient: i mean really not not any that i can think of like i tried to like i tried to write them down the piece of paper do the pro and con and like the pro look very close . and it like the same number but i mean both program are good . i have connection with like the some of the teacher and both of them . they both in the same city . like they really close to each other . they they both very similar but like for some reason i just i do know it would be easier if there like some con to one of them therapist: it will make the decision easier if you had some negative that for one of the program patient: right therapist: there for the other one . so in a way you know i guess this we call quote unquote good problem patient: right therapist: it a problem but you choosing between two alternative that are both really positive for you but it there is a choice right ? it still tough . and you mentioned before that you had some in your past you indecisive . patient: yeah . therapist: so maybe we can do in this process is help you build decision making skill or contribute to that ability . because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose you gon na have to make decision later on to patient: right therapist: and probably vary or maybe some of those will be easier maybe some of those choice wo be a easy . so i think this would be a matter of looking at what important to you . but you mentioned the research agenda already or agenda at both university that important too patient: right therapist: what are the aspect and maybe not so much thinking about these two university but in general if you had to rank order them what aspect are really the most important ? patient: um well definitely the research is up there . i definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school i go to . i think something else that important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post doctorate plan whether they have connection with like business where i can get a job like right after graduate or like if i wa going to move into a faculty position like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that like that . those are probably the biggest like the biggest influencers therapist: the research and not a guarantee necessarily but some high probability employment ? patient: right . therapist: so really what we could do here if you want to look at these two university even though we do really have any negative to look at we can rank these positive . so it sound like both have the research that you looking for that patient: bright therapist: they both there . but if you could rank and maybe you do have this information right now but if you could rank them in term of the next most important aspect which is really how hard will you work to find a job ? patient: right therapist: that that kind of what you saying . patient: okay right . therapist: i mean it sound like what you saying ? patient: right therapist: so do you have any information ? or is that something you can find ? patient: um actually that i never thought about like that . like i guess i could go online and kind of look at a lot of time university put up like job acceptance rate like afterwards and they put up percentage kind of like what what people do afterwards . so maybe if i looked at the website and kind of found information and see like how many of them go on to be professor or like work in the industry maybe maybe i should check that out . that might help me therapist: that might allow you to have a difference between them because right now it like they just kind of they kind of melded together patient: right therapist: you know you have you have really no way yet to separate them patient: right . therapist: so maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy that the gap between them so you can say okay this one neither one is bad right ? but this one might be a little better for what i want to do . patient: okay . therapist: doe that doe that kind of make sense ? patient: yeah that make sense . yeah . therapist: similarly a the i think about it i know whenever i leave speaking with somebody or some situation that right i always think of all the question i want to ask right . so when you leave here you can consider some of the other aspect and like think it over like really important to me and try to create that distance between them . so you can look at them a really two separate entity . another possibility would be to find out this information maybe talking to representative from each university . patient: okay therapist: if they may or may not have more information about potential pro and they might even have some con right now . i sure they present a plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of the negative . patient: okay . therapist: associated with the other university or maybe some of the positive that are quite a positive patient: right right therapist: something that they do well with others other university doe do a well . patient: okay . therapist: so it sound like this information gathering would really be your next step . patient: yeah . yeah . i never actually thought about ranking the the pro and going from there . so i think that a good idea . yeah . therapist: one of the thing that might be helpful to drive is the importance you place on these different aspect right . so kind of clarify and we can we meet again we talk about this but clarify your value and what important to you . patient: okay . therapist: and then that help you to kind of rank some of these attribute . patient: right . okay . yeah that make sense . therapist: all right . let let leave it there . and we kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about . unless you have any further question . patient: no no i think yeah i think i know what i can do afterwards no we decided . therapist: so i see you in about a week and we pick up there patient: alright sound good . therapist: thanks kyle . patient: hmm",
            "patient is applying for a doctor program but is stuck between two school because both the school have great research track . patient is not getting which program to choose . the patient always had such kind of trouble in making the decision . therapist asked to make pro and con table but both the program were good so therapist asked con of the program . patient told the pro are very similar but did know about con that much . therapist started a process to improve decision making skill of patient . therapist asked to look at the rank of the universites and list down the general benefit of these two school like post graduation or placement after the program etc . therapist also told that rank these university according to the positive point they have . therapist asked to collect such information and rank them before the next aspect . patient got to know that patient could go online and put up job acceptance then it will show a percentage and how many people got job a a professor or in industry . therapist gave an example like whenever patient talk to a therapist patient will ask all the question but while leaving consider only the thing according to the aspect . if they may not have more information about pro so they consider negative point of the therapist likewise it is associated with the university . some are positive and some are quite a positive . so it will give you a clarity regarding choosing either of the unversities ."

            "therapist: now one thing i thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situation in which you get really anxious . and try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you in the middle of one of those situation . so can you think of an example of something that happened recently ? patient: my daughter ha been she actually been sick . and so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and i had to go pick it up from the drugstore and that like i do usually go there . it hard to get there . like it not right in the neighborhood . so any expressway or bridge to get there not expressway but it busy it busier and attracting a mall . so you know there are six lane four lane . yeah . so it just it not someplace i usually would go . and if i wa going to go usually i would either have her go with me or my husband go with me but she wa sick and he wa at work . and therapist: so to try to understand what go through your mind that trying to take you back . and now you know that the prescription there and your daughter sick and i guess you do want to ask her to drive over there . i sorted yeah probably not the wisest idea . so you thinking about doing the drive and what going through your mind ? what are the thought that are turning inside ? patient: i just you know i sort of thinking about going there . and i already starting to think well you know what what if you know what if what if i driving and somebody crash into me what if i driving and i ca do it ? you know what if i just have to stop because i ca do it anymore and you know it wa raining and i sort of like i got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know what the picture look like ? you out in the middle of the road and stranded and it dark and my you know you know my shoe are gone . i just like it like i it would be a million mile to get back home . pretty miserable . therapist: yeah . yeah . pretty scary . patient: oh terrifying . yeah . and i just it so hard to get there . therapist: and kate a you a you put yourself back into that situation and have those thought going through your mind . what kind of feeling go along with it ? patient: my feeling i mean it thing are inside like ago anxiety physical thing are going on . well fear and anxiety and i just feel really shaky and i feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and i just do feel like i can breathe very well and therapist: it just a panic attack now ? he told me about having some bad one . patient: but it getting there not quite to a panic . therapist: yeah no it brewing . patient: yeah . okay . yeah it feel like it might . yeah therapist: yeah . what do you think we might do to try to to move thing along toward getting a plan of attack on this okay is to actually sketch this out . okay and and then see if we can figure out some thing we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on that you have right now . okay . so let put some box here . and one of them is going to be event these are the thing that trigger your anxiety . in this case the event wa patient: the driver having to drive to the to the pharmacy therapist: drive to pharmacy . and then this next box i gon na label something we call automatic thought . and but automatic i mean that they occur relatively automatically they just sort of pop into your mind and you do stop to check them out . okay and we all have these kind of automatic thought . you do have them everybody i know ha them their inner thought . in fact if you think about it for a minute we probably have a lot more thought . we do speak out loud that are part of our inner dialogue and thought we actually end up speaking aloud other people . mm hmm . and i suspect that you have lot of those thought and just give me some example of them . so that what we call an automatic . patient: so the like the what ifs ? therapist: yeah so let put a couple of those down in this box . okay in the automatic slot box and they are what if patient: someone run into me . therapist: yeah . what if what else ? patient: what if i get stranded ? therapist: get stranded . patient: i ca do it . therapist: i ca do it . and then there wa this image about the rainstorm and you do have any shoe on . yeah . so forth . what should we put down for that ? patient: i think what if i would if i ca get back home ? i ca get back on . therapist: sort of lost . yeah . patient: yeah . what if i end up on this road forever ? therapist: mm hmm . and then we going to put another box there a sort of a chain of event here . the event can make you think in way that stir up feeling of anxiety . and so if you thinking like this it make sense that you be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reaction . mm hmm . so let put those in here . this is the emotion spark they are much shaky . you said ? yeah . quite a fear . yeah . if we going to write that fear on a zero to scale and zero none at all and is the maximum anyone could ever get . where would you be at this point ? patient: oh i say about an ad therapist: ad pretty high . yeah . it gotten higher though i suspect . oh yeah . this point is in . okay . and then you had some other feeling inside ? patient: well i yeah . i sort of felt like i might fall over . i my heart wa pounding and i did feel like i can therapist: breathe . stomach any lobster . so yeah . so a lot going on here . yeah . and a pretty high level of distress . yes right . and then we going to complete this loop . putting a box we gon na call behavior . this is how you actually acted when you in the situation . so what did you do ? if you had these thought and you had these feeling patient: i went to the pharmacy . he did do it . i had to okay . therapist: and what wa it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there ? patient: it wa so bad . i just you know i i think i left permanent mark on the steering wheel because i wa whole time . therapist: okay yeah . so in this case she actually did go to the pharmacy . that year maybe it is damage to the steering wheel . yeah . yeah i hope not . patient: but i really had no choice . i mean i think usually i would go to the pharmacy . usually . i would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home get therapist: an escape route if you would ? so usually you would avoid this if we looked at this a a model . for many of these situation about driving and feeling yes the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it . okay ? and so if you do avoid it then what happens ? patient: well i feel better . you feel better . it like such a relief . therapist: better relief the emotion calm down now right ? patient: well yeah cuz i do have to like therapist: you do have to worry about it . so that what happens for a single episode of this anxiety . i wondering though if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief overall a far a managing driving what do you think it doe there ? patient: well i feel like i do really have much confidence when it come to this to be able to do therapist: it . okay . so in a way it decrease your confidence over time . i think so . yeah . i think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly give you this belief about your capacity to do these driving thing . and what that belief ? yeah patient: i do feel like i can do i ca i ca do it . therapist: i ca do it . so it really come back to this thought i ca do it . yeah . and he ca do it . you do do it . right . so here this this chain of event event trigger thought . we call them automatic thought and then they influence your emotion . he feeling you have and then that influence how you handle the situation . mm hmm . okay . now let think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this . so let take a look at these thought . do you know anybody else that drive regularly that might think differently than you ? yeah okay . i mean an example . patient: i mean i think almost everybody i think most people drive without too much . problem but like my sister love to drive . yeah i mean she just she drive every opportunity she get . therapist: so for some reason we do know exactly why . but the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this . but you do have some difference in the way you think about driving . that might be something that we could begin to work on in our session we might for example check it out what the chance of someone slamming into you ? okay what the chance of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home ? so these are some thing that we can begin to do . so i going to mark here we could work on these thought okay . and then by working on the thought we might be able to help you reduce the emotion but there are also some thing that i might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situation . so we have some try to build some skill to manage your emotion . and then on this behavior side one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving thing so that you can build your confidence back up . and again build your skill to do it . and i can see that that cause a little bit of edginess here what would you think ? patient: i wa thinking that i hope that this doe like make me worse . okay no like trying to do some of these thing . therapist: well i glad you gave me that feedback . that an example by the way of me wanting to hear from you about the way you responding to what i saying . i certainly would want to make it worse . okay but it cause you too much anxiety . uh huh . and what we try to do is pace it adjust to the level that right for you . okay so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be which is to be able to drive to your new office cross a bridge and maybe even you know drive those couple hour to visit your son . right . yeah . so what do you think ? patient: well i think that that would if i could do those thing that would be really nice . yeah therapist: that could be really nice too . so that would be our goal . yeah .",
            "the patient feel anxious for instance when they had to go to drug store to buy medicine for their daughter . the patient experience anxiety fear and almost feel like having panic attack . the patient enacts the previous scenario and fear what if they get stranded lost the way back home or end up at that road forever . these cause high level of distress for the patient . the patient agrees if they stop driving their confidence level will drop so that is not the solution . the therapist mention these are automatic thought and suggests to work on developing few skill to overcome the fearful thought . the therapist envisions the patient will be able to drive to their new office cross a bridge or drive a couple hour to meet their son . the patient feel very nice about it ."

patient: oh i see . so i i been thinking for year that that i lose it if i get get into a crowd and hear what happening again and i thinking about you know therapist: exactly if that if that the determine determine if that what we going to turn it over tomean we we never like inside letting that run your life is what brought you in here . think of all the cost that it produced . so let see if we can do something different . i got a ticket ticket a moment to sort of get in touch with how old this is . and the cost associated with me on this yeah . this pen go ? patient: whoo . therapist: mary had a little patient: plan . therapist: if i go to the mall patient: i gon na lose it . therapist: okay . world is working a it should . mind is working perfectly . it doing what mind do . that not your is that your enemy ? patient: no no i guess that just what happens therapist: is it ? patient: if i can learn that a pen go whoo in two second . therapist: okay . so here what i like to ask . we about to get up and go do this thing . we agree . and it sound like your mind is engaged . we did it to find mr . anxiety right ? so it like we here and we right on this pivot point where we going to do something different . and here the thing i like to ask you . it different but with regard to that would you be willing to do this and a you go you can tell me what coming coming up . i want you to actually watch your mind go a it construct those scary future and just notice it . like sort of like the way you carry something that fragile . want you to just to set a notice . like it not your enemy and it not your bos . it your mind doing it thing . would you be willing to sort of do it that spirit ? let see what there . this is kind of watch it go . patient: yeah i can try . yeah . but i can feel . yeah i think it my mind kicking in telling me that i going to fall apart . therapist: yeah good catch . so even that even that thought that came up a i said that let do this . okay patient: yeah i guess it is therapist: how is anxiety . patient: yeah but i not sure that i can i can do it . i been just beside myself ever since last week thinking that i wa gon na have to go through this and i not sure i can i mean chest is tight like no sweat running down my back . i petrified you know i suit you afraid of like what kind of no i actually therapist: you go there thinking what gon na happen ? patient: yeah i gon na i gon na lose it i gon na lose it before i get inside the front door lose it anyway i could predict therapist: what going to happen ? patient: but i do know . pas out i go crazy . it a i hate crowd and i hate being around those people and and you know i know i said i would i know that . we plan that we go over there but it just too much i just ca do it . therapist: okay . that surprising . you be thinking this . this is an old thought . it it where you started . i mean it how you been thinking . patient: yeah that true . but that doe mean it not true . therapist: but well let me just that ask you this term of the truth and that truth mean different thing . but in all these year you been thinking thing like that . have you actually lost it ? patient: no no but i have . i have really done it much cheaper . therapist: and then once i been able to test it to see if it really true patient: yeah i mean you know once or twice maybe i managed to spend a little time in crowd therapist: so far is appeared a a far a you know this is just a thought . patient: yeah . i guess that true . i do have any any evidence that it would absolutely happen alone . sure a hell feel like it gon na happen . therapist: so well you know be one thing . it worth noticing that and something that for u to kind of hang on to when we go there that when your mind get on you there that you remember this is just a thought it not true a far a you know from a far a we know correctly . patient: yeah i mean i guess . therapist: okay . no not true . can i do something that a little odd just a little silly to kind of look at this in a different way . patient: okay therapist: we gon na have to do something different . we not going to get anything different . patient: that make sense . therapist: so give me a cartoon character that to like patient: donald duck . therapist: okay donald duck . so suppose these thought were actually something that wa like what kind of thought would come up if you go to the mall ? it what gon na happen patient: it gon na be go to the car and sir walking towards the the entrance and it just gon na be bad . it gon na be terrible . therapist: okay so your donald duck say bad patient: that ridiculous . therapist: well first you know the thought are similarly ridiculous . i mean here you sort of turning your life over to thing that you do know are true . and that could just be silly thought about what kind of thought would come up there could we actually go there and in mentally i could do you sort of have your thought being a donald duck horse just so that you can see them a something that silly which may be able to give you a little bit of freedom from them because you know what happens if you just turn you know turn your life over huh ? patient: yeah i mean i guess they are pretty silly thought and i not sure that i can do that voice quite so well therapist: versus the result of a misspent youth . what other kind of thought yeah like if you go patient: yeah you know if i if i go am i gon na lose i gon na hyperventilate . yeah i see we come from yeah that well therapist: i just want you to sort of hang on to that a little bit when it really get up on you so that you can remember these thing are not true a far a you know . and there it is kind of a silly thing to allow them to do what they done . and so we just you tell me what they are . if you it mentally in your head i say it out loud . i can probably say most of these thought . donald back wise would you be willing to do it that way ? patient: yeah well i have to say i think make it a lot easier . just distract but therapist: never mind . what would you say patient: okay . therapist: so what inside this decision ? patient: well i just get really nervous because i supposed to choose i have one more semester left and i get worried because i not sure if i on the right path and i do want to make the wrong decision . and then my parent are telling me you know my dad want me to do one thing and and i feel like i just get it thrown in lot of different direction . and and then my teacher tell me one thing and i just feel like there six of me trying to do different thing . therapist: if you could settle them down just to to the two major one what would be the two major alternative that you have here ? patient: well i mean ultimately my family and i still want to have friend and i really young still and i get and then the career choice and wanting to be successful . therapist: okay . which of those is more important you think ? patient: well i mean i definitely feel a lot better when i around people that i love and stuff but then also i always been told career the most important thing and making money and and all that but i just i just keep feeling like i failing . therapist: okay so it seems like if you do one you do get the other and if that really true are there thing in there where you could do both patient: well i mean i feel like if i committed to school then i committed to school . and i just do have the time . therapist: yet it doe doe take time but not forever . patient: or no but for now therapist: seems like you kind of almost anxious when you talk about it here . patient: yeah it it make me i just ca really because i do know . i just do know what the right direction to go in . therapist: i do know . maybe you just need to follow your heart here is make a choice . but how long have you been sitting on this fence ? it obviously it seems like you sitting on a fence . patient: well i mean i guess since i had to choose which college to go to in high school . therapist: is there any other way to do it other than just the nike solution ? just do it ? patient: i do i do see it . i mean i feel like i am just doing it . i just not going anywhere with it . okay ? therapist: maybe we just not thinking about it broadly enough in an open enough way . patient: i feel like i covering all the base . therapist: oh what inside this choice i guess ? patient: well i just feel like i get torn into different piece trying to please my family and my friend but then also trying to be motivated to choose a career which i still do know what i want to do . therapist: even a you say that there a sort of sense that we entering into a kind of chattery world do you feel a though you kind of getting into space ? patient: yeah therapist: like if we were to just do it metaphorically like how close are your thought about am i doing the right thing if we use distance a a metaphor for how close to have a sense that patient: yeah yeah . blinding . therapist: yeah yeah exactly . and that is that a pretty familiar place to be ? patient: yeah . therapist: right . patient: yeah . therapist: so and not just in this area right ? patient: no therapist: without without any other decision and choice . so it just worth noticing that you know that kind of how your mind work . probably trying to help you out here but it doing something that probably pretty familiar . but what would happen if we kind of just sort of noticed more openly what your mind doing and also just what showing up for you and in your body and your emotion ? we look at the sec nice . notice the kind of almost holding patient: yeah therapist: like this decision ha been made now . patient: yeah . therapist: so come back to it now and just sort of watch your mind kind of come up like this and see if we can just kind of watch it . there . okay so you do have a choice to make . there only one . i mean life is finite do get to do everything . right right . yeah . and that a little scary . yeah . and so what doe your mind start saying to you ? patient: well i feel like every time i make a positive decision to go one way it leaving another thing behind and then i hold on to the thing that i going to be missing out on . therapist: yeah exactly . so just before do grab that . so provide them close . just did notice that . okay . and would that be okay to have that sort of sense ? i do know if i made the right decision . like what inside that ? would it be okay to have that thought ? patient: it scary to not know therapist: yeah it is . patient: but i mean i guess i do really have control over that . okay . therapist: and could we sort of open up it is a little scary . we make choice you do open door and you close others . patient: yeah . therapist: and even that sound a bit scary . is that okay . there something supposed to happen here when you make career choice is it not supposed to have any scariness to it ? patient: well it is scary . so yeah . therapist: so let see if we can just kind of open up to that . but that okay too . you not doing anything wrong here . it not an indication something bad is happening here . patient: right .",
            "patient feel anxious all the time but doe know the reason for it . patient facing this issue since childhood . therapist say that he will wirte a history a a part of the routine where therapist want to understand the patient what all thing happened in the patient life by giving an example of a pen situation . therapist asks patient to watch patient mind and set up a notice which say the mind is doing everything . patient practised it for a week . the patient did this practice useful patient still living in anxiety of losing . patient still hate to go to a crowded place . therapist understands the thought patient have his just a thought it not true . therapist started a different way and asked patient about the favourite cartoon character . therapist start relating the conversation to that character . therapist asked about two major alternative . patient answered family friend career choice and being successful in future . patient first preference is for a career but feel like failing in it . patient is confused to choose a right direction since school time . patient torned himself into differenct piece like please family friend and also trying to be motivated to choose a career . whenever patient go out with positive thought he leaf something behind . therapist suggested patient to convience the mind that just did notice the thing and not to pressurize the mind . at the end therapist convinced patient that everything okay and it all normal ."

            "therapist: doe the feeling itself of not being prepared interfere with preparing ? patient: yes it really hard . so like when i in the middle of being worried i it really hard for me to focus . so i ca focus on like what i need to do . because i feel like my mind is on a lot of different thing and i ca focus on you know exactly what i should be doing . it just like i worried about you know all the different aspect . therapist: alright so your ability to concentrate and do the hard work of preparing is affected patient: yeah it like focus my energy on the right thing . i just like wasting time worrying . therapist: alright so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing all this go on right up until you getting ready to present patient: yeah . and then like while i presenting therapist: so let talk about that let go into the actual day a present so we have a successive work coming in it interfering with your ability but it distressing for you . patient: yeah . therapist: now these presentation are in class ? patient: yeah therapist: so it you in you in the classroom . do you write the only one to present in that classroom is it rotate through several pv ? patient: it depends on the presentation . sometimes there like one or two other people that have to present that night depending on like how long the topic is . therapist: all right well let choose the last time you presented that class a a template . what wa the order to go in there ? patient: well the one that i really messed up i think in that i wa first but usually like i like second maybe . therapist: okay . so for this example let say you through the second . okay so you sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting . what going through mind that ? patient: i feel like i am totally zoned out . like i not even paying attention to what that person saying because i so worried about how i gon na mess it up . you know i i starting to like be sweaty like my hand are clammy my heart started to race a little bit and i just totally zoned out on what they doing . just you know worrying about what gon na happen when i get up there . therapist: so in that moment a you seated you not really watching their presentation a much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptom . you have your heart racing a bit is sweaty palm . you zoned out . have you ever felt the need desire to like run out of the room ? patient: yes . it funny you should say that wa a little bit hesitant to mention that but i kind of i do i feel like i need to find excuse to like use the bathroom or i just need to get out of there . therapist: yeah so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room like what ? what symptom ? patient: um therapist: and what thought are going through your mind right then like so let take that kind of severe moment . when you you let just say still before the presentation okay ? so you sitting at the desk and your heart rate elevated . and you not focusing on what they doing . you zoned out your anxiety high . what wa going through your mind right then ? patient: i think i thinking like i gon na bomb this anyway . so i might a well just you know not go through the stress of having to do it . like i already in my head i know that it going to end badly . therapist: so you already failed . patient: right . so there no sense in getting up there . and maybe if i do get up there you know i guess it could be any worse . so i might a well just leave therapist: are you embarrassed that the professor or other student will see that you were really anxious ? patient: yeah i do want i figure if i leave and people wo will just make me think i wa sick or whatever . and it be a better situation if i just left then happened to see me up there you know sweating and all these other symptom that i have when i actually get up there it would be better just to leave before that start . therapist: okay . so so better to be thought ill and had to leave because you saying . patient: yeah or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody you know therapist: to have a severe anxiety for that buddy . and then they can very embarrassing . that would be a very undesirable outcome for you . patient: right . therapist: so a you debating that thought because that coming to your head and you thinking i just need to yeah got ta get out here . what happens there so we maybe what minute before we present ? so tell me about that . so you have that thought you want to flee patient: right . and i looking at the clock and saying you know like how much more time in this presentation before i have to go like should i go ? should i not go ? what are the consequence of running out ? you know and kind of playing out which would be worse ? therapist: have you ever had to run out ? patient: um once i went to the bathroom to try to like calm myself down or talk to myself or you know like cool off my face . um but i came back therapist: and you presented then you presented alright so you you survived . one of the more stressful presentation patient: yeah i almost felt like i wa gon na be ill . i wa so stressed that day . therapist: that wa very very tough on you . what happened on that particular day ? patient: so typically like i go to load my presentation at this point like i have my new card or whatever in front of me . i am like shaking at this point . i am so i do know if it scared or worried or maybe a combination of everything . and i just like sweating . my heart is racing . like i almost feel dizzy . i just so stressed out about what going to happen . and then you know i starting to speak . and then the presentation are usually like minute or so . okay so i have to stay up there for the duration and i just like you know sweating and then i wondering like are people looking at me or people ? can people see it ? you know am i going to forget something ? therapist: so the some of the thought are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if you gon na do poorly on the presentation patient: right . or they think i been lazy and i did prepare are they going to think that you know i dumb or i do know you know what i doing . therapist: so they might they might think le of you a a person . patient: right . or like be judging me . okay . therapist: yeah . so there a number of concern that kind of going through your mind in that moment . so when doe this start to turn around so you start presenting is minute you initially get up there and get your presentation up on the the projection monitor . yeah . when doe it start to turn the corner ? patient: um it depends sometimes i settled down a little bit but then usually like that i get some sort of rhythm i think . and then but then it get anxiety again until i get my grade . do you know what i mean ? and i like until because i feel like i gon na do poorly . until that happens when therapist: when you receive the grade . patient: sometimes like she usually doe give them that day but like often like the next day or the day after therapist: so doe that intense anxiety that you having while you presenting last all the way ? patient: now ? it definitely like dissipates once i can like go sit down . therapist: okay so so the sort of next big drop off for symptom would be when you done with the presentation patient: yeah when eye are maybe no longer on me . they moved on to somebody else . so i figured like okay they forgot about me . i safe . therapist: all right then . but then there this other worry of now we have to see what the grade are right ? patient: and i convince myself that i did poorly . therapist: so the thought is going through your mind is i gon na receive a bad grade . patient: yeah and that everyone saw me you know sweating and all these symptom that i have everyone is judging me",
            "the patient is worried and it is hard for them to focus . the patient is not able to present to the class successfully . if it their turn to present next they zone out completely heart racing sweating and think of walking out . the patient once walked out of a presentation but came back and presented . the patient is anxious if the people could see them sweating and other symptom or if they think the patient ha prepared . the patient feel they might be judged . after the presentation the patient anxiety level immediately drop once they are seated and everyone eye are off them . but then they are anxious about their grade next which will be given in a day or two for which the patient convinces themselves that they did poorly ."
