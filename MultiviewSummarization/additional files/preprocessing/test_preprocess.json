            "therapist: jason how you doing sir \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: you all right \\s patient: im just here \\s therapist: youre just here just here i understand that youre in hospital couple weeks ago \\s patient: yeah i was in hospital about two weeks ago did something i had to go to hospital afterwards \\s therapist: what happened \\s patient: yeah so about two weeks ago i was finishing up this wonderful machine that i was creating in my room so that government cant hear my thoughts or my my actions or my behaviors i was just trying to finish up my last little bit that i needed to build i went over to neighbor because their garage was open just picked out tool brought it back to house when i was in house working on my my room cops came picked me up took me to hospital so its like see government data to get \\s therapist: what you think government trying to do \\s patient: theyre trying to stop me from actually creating my room because theyre theyre creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them im not follower i know what i want i know what i need i know what my family wants i know what they need im just trying to protect them by creating my room \\s therapist: tell me about your room what what are you doing there that makes that special \\s patient: so i was smart enough to know that there are frequencies waves that are out there that government actually sending you through lights also through tv like through every electronic apparatus that out there im actually creating doll or wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening so that you can actually live life that you want be happy youthful joyful all time \\s therapist: that how you were feeling when you were building \\s patient: yeah because i created this prototype in my room anytime im basically in there i was it was good i had energy i didnt have everything that i wanted but my prototype was running out of fuel so i needed to make it bigger larger so it can run longer \\s therapist: thats what youre trying to do \\s patient: yeah thats what i was trying to do when i wouldnt borrowed tools from my neighbor but yeah then also i was ordering some things that were online they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that base piece that i was creating that i use tools for my neighbors house it could have been all perfect set so that when all of hard drives in electrical wiring all of that stuff came in i could just plug it in then not only my room covered but also my houses covered all of my family they could just be happy \\s therapist: they could be happy they could be happy like you know you were happy \\s patient: i was happy like so two weeks ago i was i was good i i was up i did all calculations that i need to create so i can actually build my base in my system but then i also did calculations about different types of waves being in house but then also out of house that i also had opportunity to just not sleep because i need sleep i wasnt tired if i did sleep i slept for like 15 minutes just because i needed to finish what i was going to do i was so close to finishing my neighbour called cops \\s therapist: so you had period of time when you had like lot of energy you werent really sleeping much \\s patient: doesnt everybody do that \\s therapist: youre also happy felt energetic \\s patient: i felt good like when i when i sleep i dont like when i sleep because it just feels wrong \\s therapist: how do you feel now in comparison \\s patient: im alright guy all right just all right right now government maybe get on different medication so just all right \\s therapist: so not happy or sad \\s patient: not sad either its just you in middle \\s therapist: do you want to get back to that happiness \\s patient: of course who doesnt want to get back to happiness of their life thats reason why you need to finish machine \\s therapist: yeah you mentioned you ordered some products online how much did you order \\s patient: um i think i ordered probably know exact number i ordered 236 hard drives because 236 perfect number that i needed to not only cover my bedroom so i can always be happy if system went down my room was always going to be covered but then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy thats reason why im kind of angry at my one neighbor because i was including his house in all by my grid so that he can also be happy all time \\s therapist: he would have been affected by machine \\s patient: of course hes helping hand he helped me out he let me borrow his tools but evidently he didnt let me borrow him this time so just pull him out have another neighbor take his place \\s therapist: were all those hard drives fairly expensive \\s patient: i dont know when i was up cleaning running around house trying to find more equipment i found my moms purse i was just like oh my god she has credit card in there oh my god i can use our credit card so i was using our credit card because its trying to make her happy so i dont know i added 236 they were probably 50 to 100 apiece depending on where it could get them i just ordered them \\s therapist: howd your mother respond to that \\s patient: my mom came to hospital was like where are all these boxes coming from its like this but im in my room she put them into my room then like week ago she has like i see my credit card she wants to happen \\s therapist: that strange relationship \\s patient: no thats just how we have relationship generally \\s therapist: you get along okay \\s patient: we get along perfectly fine like thats thats how we talk to each other like we talk to each other minimally because shes not in my room so shes not happy so anytime she does come into my room it messes up balance so i get unhappy then i just tell her to stay out so that i can be happy she can be happy in her own place \\s therapist: you mentioned that they changed medications in hospital \\s patient: government changed for medications \\s therapist: how are you feeling about taking your medications \\s patient: while so \\s therapist: right you you really want to get back to work on that machine \\s patient: yes i want to be back in my happy place \\s therapist: have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before youre hospitalized \\s patient: now i havent been that motivated big i know im going to get it done its just i just dont know if im gonna get it done today or tomorrow but i know whats gonna get done \\s therapist: you still want to get that done its important to know \\s patient: its really important because i cant be controlled by government anymore \\s therapist: by jason id like you to continue seeing counselor here if you found counsellor to be helpful \\s patient: counselor has been okay \\s therapist: but that okay its been okay but well continue to counseling hope that can can help you bit i appreciate you spending this time with me explain what happened \\s patient: thank you",

it physical so yeah \\s therapist: do you remember what thoughts going on \\s patient: um my thoughts are like im in car im gonna get hit if im taking test its like okay i gotta do well on this test i gotta remember this theres so much to remember i just kind of brings freezing little bit im panicking because i cant remember so i guess so have you found that no problem which was not being able to complete task \\s therapist: four it worth once you go through \\s patient: um it like anxiety over when i finished test yeah yeah after im finished i mean i know i could do perform better if i was going because i knew it wouldnt take me as long if i wasnt anxious um it seems to me like time tests so when its over whether its an hour or two hours or however long it maybe its over you know im anxious during it but when its over yeah it kind of subsides just like in car like when i get to place after im off interstate stuff it seemed to subside so when situation over it seems to seems to go down \\s therapist: so sounds like you might need to find something that helps \\s patient: yeah i also think that time tell me in moment because these are things that i mean i cant avoid i mean even in my job to ive got to go my field placement ive got to do these group settings you know ive got to do kids are crazy theyre disrespectful like okay i got to do it though so all these things i have to do i cant change them my wife right now so got to figure out how to deal with it better \\s therapist: would you like to describe that \\s patient: yeah im very eager to learn something that can make difference \\s therapist: well theres something called grounding do you know \\s patient: no just lectricity grounding you know that third floor thing thats only grounding i know i need to be grounded that sounds good bring it on \\s therapist: so with grounding lot of people have lot of emotions okay to have emotions but for some people it gets really intense like lot no one wants to bring that down to more of calm place so it doesnt necessarily solve problem like theres still traffic yeah nothings going on which just helps you get to place to deal with \\s patient: that sounds good \\s therapist: so im going to introduce grounding technique to you okay involves some deeper events in closing eyes getting to your senses okay so i have little script okay \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: theyll tell me after id be like okay \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: but somebody gave me i just want to know relax comfortable comfortable resting hands on your side whatever was working for you pretty good i dont want you to disappoint chest rises so dont worry about it just okay what comfortable now were gonna gauge use in each of five senses so for that i want you to close your eyes i want you to listen to my voice read my instructions so lets begin to relax by just noticing all sounds around to start with \\s patient: air conditioning going on over air coming through \\s therapist: for constant noise \\s patient: umm yeah \\s therapist: notice sound before like that \\s patient: no just hearing it now \\s therapist: lets move on to smell do you smelling anything \\s patient: just totally okay lot of sense right now in this room for smelling bad or good its just normal yeah no any smelly smells nice no air \\s therapist: now to open up about site so im just listening something so as you can see in this one right now you picture right there dear or whatever it what about colors of what you see on \\s patient: blue red lot of bage orange clashing colors red orange one of those go together \\s therapist: yeah when he first came here did you notice \\s patient: mean i might have noticed some of it but im obviously more aware because im really focusing on it right now so im more aware of it right now \\s therapist: so maxwidth taste notice i can just tell you some other situation you can take time to like snack or something talk about taste texture well its totally food feel okay \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: you can still do even without food just simply face enough saliva okay \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: something new this morning \\s patient: well kind of granola bar banana earlier so get some tea just flavor right now my mouth probably tea that i just had most recently \\s therapist: then finally well touch on science so when you hands on right now \\s patient: ive had this kind of habit of mine to kind of feel my hands my hands are supposed to be here \\s therapist: describe to me how it feels \\s patient: it was solid or solid soft rubber or anything like that secure like okay its its gonna hold me thats good feeling comfortable just comfortable \\s therapist: so what were just able to just went through each of senses as way of bit of extraction from here this also can be called lying down to details then something else at end you can say so how does that feel \\s patient: well wow he kind of did calm me down i mean i was kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious so i was kind of revved up then i kind of forgot about it because i was focusing on you know what i was seeing what i was feeling when i was you know all my senses of so it was very distracting damon good way i got my mind off of that kind of got me on to something else then yeah they really did cut me down \\s therapist: was there certain sense that you werent most help \\s patient: troubling right here since im not eaten probably what im seeing what im hearing those two things seem to be most helpful in this situation yeah that feeling too \\s therapist: so lets talk about how we can use this because obviously cant close your eyes right \\s patient: true true true true \\s therapist: so what can you do i drive sensors can be used \\s patient: seen obviously my eyes better be open i better be observant about what imfeeling i got my hands on wheel so im going to be feeling something so in hearing you know so sort of hearing \\s therapist: do you have any kind of peacefulness \\s patient: well its good idea was wasnt in mpr sometimes thats good sometimes thats not good you know dont necessarily call me down sometimes i can get so i should probably i could i can listen to some more soothing music something that calms me down more also \\s therapist: yeah yeah \\s patient: yeah yeah i think music might be more because not that i want to be distracted from cars but i think my music might call me down more than having nothing you know like quiet hearing cars growth might i can see that might make me nervous i need to be aware of them but i think i want to hear music so ill try that yeah \\s therapist: yeah im focusing on car in front of you \\s patient: yeah yeah not necessarily one behind me that might hit me too much for that so okay okay now \\s therapist: lets think about when so what sensors can we tap into \\s patient: well when im looking at definitely i need to focus on because im reading something of course im feeling my pin most of us on computer so im feeling typewriter typewriter keyboard so thats sense of touching things but i got to focus on seen as paying attention to words on front of me \\s therapist: hearing \\s patient: i like to be quiet for just \\s therapist: so not too much about function of things like when you have to type on keyboard you know \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: okay so next time when you try to tap into census okay if you want to take just five minute break so for each sense that one minute okay like before i start test or before i start to drive or something okay okay to kind of do that \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: also your statement okay \\s patient: which i can do this gussto okay i can do this \\s therapist: okay so when you will do this \\s patient: well i got to drive home so probably today when i drive home i could do that test i dont really have test till next week but when i drive all time so every day \\s therapist: you know before we even we yeah so when youre sitting \\s patient: okay get ready i call her in parking lot okay took that time take few minutes to go through all senses focus on that put some soothing music on say i can do itand then proceed \\s therapist: okay so thats okay \\s patient: ill try that yeah \\s therapist: see how it goes well talk about it \\s patient: okay thanks yeah sure ill take some practice \\s therapist: okay because situation right now \\s patient: yeah okay \\s therapist: dont try to focus too much on okay make you aware of your surroundings okay okay \\s patient: okay okay \\s therapist: all right well thanks for that \\s patient: alright",

            "therapist: so chris i wanted to talk to you know youre one of our star athletes really value you as team player as athletic director one of my jobs to kind of keep tabs on players make sure everybody performing at their best something came up this weekend ive been hearing some chatter about big party that went down understand you were there so i wanted to talk to you little bit about how partying alcohol fits in your life right now \\s patient: okay oh actually could i can find something new that doesnt bother me lately well prior to that party like as you know im an honor student my parents like they keep me very like kick kept down out of lake salt lake social life i own about month ago my friends invited me to party they use fact that all im always doing my homework always studying that to allow me to go to party on \\s therapist: hmm umm \\s patient: well that party i managed to convince my parents i would spend night at my friends house \\s therapist: ahmm \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: alright \\s patient: so i thats when i started drinking was unique experience as you could say i guess you can say i dont know it was fun at least in that moment so i kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam i asked my i begged my mom to let me go to another party she kind of knew what i was doing she asked me to like to promise her oh no alcohol no drugs man ill pick you up by 12 our surprise told us basically when party starts but i saw that whatever i saw i thought to myself that ill ill come out figure it out to delay her coming to me later \\s therapist: uhh hmm \\s patient: so later so she promised that she dropped me off i promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go out have fun like ive ive been having i was drinking then its time time came for her to pick me up as soon as i couldnt delay her for hanging out as soon as she picked me up i stepped in car she said you drank vodka im like i didnt know what to say i just looked at floor i feel terrible because i betrayed my mother i broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol thats exactly what i did \\s therapist: so here you are youre an honor student your star athlete youve kind of been doing everything youve been told for all these years maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in party scene it was fun at first but now youre already noticing some consequence \\s patient: right like ive been noticing ive been more lethargic apathetic towards schoolwork \\s therapist: ahhh hmmm \\s patient: really i kind of just sit in class like my mind elsewhere especially on way weekends where instead of instead of studying im caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age stuff like that \\s therapist: it has really changed your focus what do you like about drinking \\s patient: i dont know it its because im very reserved person for most part not well not when im doing sports but like like social environment i tend to keep to myself because im very self conscious i would say when i drink i feel like it relaxes me im able to talk or engage with other people more easily its just \\s therapist: so it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed \\s patient: exactly \\s therapist: sounds like youre noticing quite few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you youre having decreased focus youre kind of not doing so well in school maybe any other things \\s patient: just different group friends of group girlfriends like different people that im hanging out not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene so that thats also changed \\s therapist: so your your friends that you were hanging out with theres little tension there now \\s patient: little bit because not all of them are into that so like im in one group of friends i will talk to another person within another group of friends they just happen to invite me to that first party \\s therapist: hmm hmm \\s patient: so since then ive been hanging out more with them getting to know them but i could also see that on just living life i guess but thats also not fair to them that im not there for them as much as i was before as they are there for me yeah \\s therapist: well given that youve sort of noticed all these changes where its affecting your friendships its affecting your studying its affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should kind of go from here \\s patient: oh i should i should stop i mean like im not not unrealistic \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: i understand that situations like this will happen its just up to me not to take it so far where i cant remember night before if im puking all i remember toilet \\s therapist: umm \\s patient: thats thats not worth it either i have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was thats big blow as little or like as it may seem to other people like to me that its big thing \\s therapist: your mom really important to you \\s patient: of course \\s therapist: how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit \\s patient: im pretty confident \\s therapist: especially on scale of 1 to 10 where one not at all 10 completely what number \\s patient: probably like an eight or nine im i cant be in time because nothings attend my field theres too many factors but i feel like im determined to \\s therapist: why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven \\s patient: because i dont know i feel determined to to make sure this happens because i dont like how i felt after i betrayed my mother i dont like remembering that feeling of like vomiting \\s therapist: umm hmm \\s patient: its not pleasant experience its not something that i wish to enjoy so like even if i do drink i dont want to drink to point where that happens like all fun that i have then prior to that just its not worth its not worth drinking \\s therapist: right what do you thinks realistic goal for you then \\s patient: to make sure i have my studies well first try to get back my trust with my mother \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: then just focus on my studies then if i have time for leisure time like ill go party with my friends just be as party with them doesnt mean i have to drink i do one cup not gonna do anything to my life either but id prefer not to do that i prefer just make sure \\s therapist: your goals to not drink at all or if you are at party maximum of one at very moment \\s patient: exactly just so i take part with social convention but its not hey guys its about doing yeah \\s therapist: chris i really appreciate you talking with me about this i know it seems like something thats been on your mind as it you know like i said i really care about you as student an athlete want whats best for you so im glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all if you find yourself in situation where theres alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum sounds like something thatll work for you \\s patient: thank you for listening listening to me \\s therapist: yeah its my pleasure its part of my job part i like best so we better hurry up get changed for practice",

            "therapist: okay so i noticed on your diary card that you have that you did cut \\s patient: yep \\s therapist: okay so lets talk about that little bit when what day did that happen on \\s patient: tuesday \\s therapist: tuesday okay so where were you on tuesday when you first had thought that you wanted to cut \\s patient: where i usually always am at school i was on my walker thats stupid girl \\s therapist: what was going on at your locker \\s patient: melanie was talking about tim my tim my boyfriend i know it was it was my tim she was talking about i just wanted to punch her so bad \\s therapist: okay so you were sending out your locker you heard somebody say something about tim that you didnt want to hear \\s patient: yeah she was talking about him he had he didnt text me night before so who knows whats going on \\s therapist: what were you feeling right then \\s patient: so angry so angry \\s therapist: on scale of one to 10 how angry would you say you were \\s patient: like nine \\s therapist: pretty angry then \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what did you do right then you ride your locker whats next thing you did after you heard it \\s patient: next thing i did i slammed my locker i walked down to gym but what i wanted to do was push her adn punch her \\s therapist: so i know that gym usually to place where you cut because you said you can go behind bleachers people dont usually see you there \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so were between hearing person talking about tim going to gym where did you decide to cut because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody there must have been point where you decided im going to cut \\s patient: i think it was right after i slammed my locker thought i cant punch her im going to get in trouble im going to go cut \\s therapist: okay so that was when you decided to cut you went down to gym \\s patient: mm hmm \\s therapist: what happened when you got there \\s patient: well nobody was there because gym classes are in morning so i knew that nobody was going to come in gym so i went behind bleachers \\s therapist: what did you use to cut \\s patient: pencil that i have always used \\s therapist: same pencil as usual \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: metal tip \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay that was pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of \\s patient: yeah i know its just its its my favorite pencil i i use it for school i just its my favorite pencil \\s therapist: okay so you still have pencil you got under bleachers you say you were feeling angry still are you still on scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under bleachers \\s patient: i was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight half though because i i knew i knew i was gonna cut \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: so it like came down little bit \\s therapist: what were you thinking at that point \\s patient: well i thought couple things i thought im glad i kept this pencil that im just so pissed that i just want to cut so badly \\s therapist: so you have your pencil where did you cut \\s patient: on my leg \\s therapist: how many times \\s patient: three \\s therapist: how deep did you cut where it was deep enough that you needed band aid did you need more than band aid \\s patient: no i mean i guess i could have used band aid but whatever \\s therapist: but it wasnt so deep that you needed something more \\s patient: no \\s therapist: okay right after you cut where were you on scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger \\s patient: like three \\s therapist: three what were you thinking right afterwards \\s patient: that felt good i feel better im gonna have to talk to michelle about this \\s therapist: did that feeling last you for rest of day \\s patient: feeling better yeah for most part yeah it did \\s therapist: okay so thats what happened right afterwards \\s patient: mm hmm \\s therapist: later in day are we thinking about cutting \\s patient: well i kind of forgot about it \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: but then i just started thinking about it again right before bad just feeling really guilty that i cut because i knew i was going to have to talk about it with you i just i mean i night time i just i constantly think about what happened that day then what next day going to be like i mean you know its usually pretty hard time \\s therapist: i know night really difficult time for you everything seems worse at night yeah so you were thinking back at back on it then you were feeling guilty \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: sounds like you werent feeling so good about it then as you were in afternoon \\s patient: no that always seems to happen \\s therapist: sounds like for you cutting works for little while but it doesnt last \\s patient: yeah i guess so \\s therapist: i knew youve also been working on doing less cutting \\s patient: ive been doing pretty good \\s therapist: you have youve been working really hard im just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you wont have those guilty feelings \\s patient: yeah maybe i mean those guilty feelings really suck \\s therapist: okay so with cutting it sounds like point where you decided to cut out your locker what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about tim \\s patient: yeah cuz shes stupid \\s therapist: okay it sounds like youre also already having pretty bad day you said he hadnt called he hadnt been texting us that was on your mind \\s patient: yeah thats right \\s therapist: so im wondering if that point if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of cutting \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: thatll bring that anger from nine down little bit \\s patient: its not going to bring it down all way to three though ill tell you that much \\s therapist: it might not but itll bring it down little bit maybe each thing you try brings it down little bit more \\s patient: all right \\s therapist: maybe therell be things will feel good about later you wont have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back \\s patient: all right \\s therapist: so first thing that pencil it sounds like its comforting to have it \\s patient: yeah it \\s therapist: it also sounds like its tempting what do you think about that \\s patient: i mean only if i am in mood to cut its tempting \\s therapist: having that pencil going to make it harder to try other things when youve been talking about how youre really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less \\s patient: yeah i am \\s therapist: sounds like that pencils standing in your way \\s patient: yeah maybe \\s therapist: what do you think about getting rid of pencil this time choosing different favorite pencil that maybe you cant cut with \\s patient: i mean maybe only only if its can be like really cool pencil \\s therapist: that way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which wont tempt you thatll make it easier to try two things \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay what do you think our first thing should be what do you think you can try you just heard somebody say something you dont want to hear youre feeling pretty angry what can you do in that moment \\s patient: oh what i do lot at home when my moms bothering me saying stuff i dont want to hear i put my headphones on \\s therapist: do you have your headphones with you at school \\s patient: yeah they they they actually they let me keep them on in school \\s therapist: that something youd be willing to try next time \\s patient: i think so theres theres few songs that usually helped me so i think so \\s therapist: okay that sounds like good one to try so we have headphones we need to come up with one more what do you think youd like to try \\s patient: well i really like my teacher mrs xion so she seems to always kind of be there when i need to talk her rooms kind of right down hallway from my locker than same hallway so i guess i could talk to her \\s therapist: that sounds like good option thats our goal to keep pushing cutting further down list keep adding things that youre going to try first youre right that first thing you try it might not bring you all way down to two or three but it might bring you down little bit each thing you try might bring you down just little bit more so you have to be willing to try few things can you do that \\s patient: i can but i really want like cooler pencil though like like cooler pencil so i dont know maybe maybe we could go look for pencil together \\s therapist: i think thats good idea \\s patient: okay id like that \\s therapist: okay thank you for answering all my questions on this you did great job with this chain i know it wasnt easy \\s patient: yeah youre welcome \\s therapist: lets go look for pencil",
            "The patient has been angry that another girl had been talking about their boyfriend Tim near their locker the other day. They were angry at a score of 9 out of 10. The patient decided to go to the gym behind the bleachers to cut themselves, by using their favorite pencil with metal head. They cut on their leg three times. The patient scored their anger 3 out of 10 after the cut. The patient felt guilty for cutting themselves. The therapist suggests to think of alternatives, and asks to buy a new favorite pencil and get rid of metal head pencil. They discuss another idea to put on headphones if they wish to avoid to hear things that make them angry. The patient suggested that they will talk to Mrs. Xion who seems to be kind. The therapist assures these ideas if tried will slowly help and accompanies the patient to buy a new pencil. "

happening for you around that time i mean you talked about pressure of your exams staying up for them was anything else going on same time \\s patient: well so to end of end of university that was time where all as soon as that period stopped of work then i was sort of let off leash bit yeah i just thought to grow even further so i mentioned i was i was taking ritalin to block coffee as soon as our exams had stopped i just substance abuse of took bit more of hold yeah i just sort of grew into this person who i thought was him was guy that everyone wanted to be around to see so i made sure that i was just everywhere that could be seen i was \\s therapist: this like there they got after you finish exams but before results are out \\s patient: yeah so we will just scan out lot but if not every night \\s therapist: he said that you were taking ritalin drinking lot of coffee \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: then using other drugs as well \\s patient: yeah so developed into cocaine lot okay ameri car \\s therapist: hows that affect you \\s patient: i honestly was on cloud nine at time yeah i was just always person ever wanted everyone wanted to know in my head i was like i put myself at center of universe i even i convinced friend of mine who develops apps that we should if i had an idea to develop an app about when you go into alcohol shop that it all way up put out whats most cost effective way to get wasted \\s therapist: right \\s patient: so yeah i mean i at time i was spending lot of money lot of my parents savings i got credit card which i didnt tell them about so in this sort of role as man as man about town i was spent lot on yeah ill hold drugs close invested in this technology i was \\s therapist: so it sounds like it began with kind of exam pressure putting more pressure on yourself to stay up using kind of stimulants keep yourself awake then you started to feel like you were more more man you were you were kind of popular you were successful how did you respond to cope with those symptoms what did you do once those are kind of begun \\s patient: well having not had to deal with my illness throughout university for it not being part of that world i i didnt confront those symptoms in in way thats gonna have long term stability as well it began with doing work that i needed to do thats just thats just what i needed to do in order to achieve my goals to achieve what i want to then it just i just let it take hold i it was all part of it wasnt it wasnt yeah it wasnt illness it was me it was just i was in i was master of this whole situation i was everything that was happening was down to my own doing \\s therapist: so it sounds on one hand you didnt confront it you kind of just let it roll on other hand you said that you kind of took it as evidence that you were very energetic you were powerful this was all kind of explained about who you were i guess how did that affect you looking at things in that way \\s patient: it just it was my time it all been leading to like this was moment where i would sort of like become person that i want it to be all hard work all everything while work that my parents had done for me all work that i had been doing it was now crystallizing \\s therapist: for you on brink of something yeah mess from sounds of it again going back to that kind of beginnings ah where you started to stay up late use stimulants i mean how much sleep were you getting at beginning \\s patient: they saw it gradually diminished i think it began at six five was ended up about three two \\s therapist: what kind of things did you notice did you notice any changes from having less less sleep in your body maybe way you were thinking \\s patient: think harder i was working faster my brain then will work how much harder i work more i would do so it was it wasnt it was just yeah momentum was building more than anything my thoughts were firing my goals was stronger in my yeah my determination was \\s therapist: how did you feel in your body did you notice any changes physically \\s patient: no i couldnt recall time maybe i was trying to get my way i was avoiding avoiding confronting any negative effects but nothing powerful comes on \\s therapist: okay i wants you to kind of things were bit further along after your exams he said youre going out lot you convinced your friend to do this app was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldnt normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than youd like it to be \\s patient: there was i hide lot of savings that my my parents had built up for me which i probabiliy dont really exist anymore either through money invested through drugs clothes i had girlfriend at time but because it was because i was main character in sense it always was only only person that matters so sort of those around me especially still didnt really have as much importance so on nights out i wouldnt she just wouldnt be in my mind so that would be other women \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: so \\s therapist: how do you feel about that now looking back on it \\s patient: i think its its those moments where its not just me its those those closest to you those around you that have to suffer more than anyone else that brings lot of shame",

            "therapist: hi gabriela i understand that youre here today because youve been experiencing some low mood \\s patient: yeah i just then recently ive just been feeling down lot i cant really like snap out of it like sometimes if its happened before i can just like get myself back on track but recently ive just found it really difficult to do it \\s therapist: so it sounds like youve been experiencing some low mood youre kind of struggling to get going bit \\s patient: yeah yeah definitely \\s therapist: youve had low mood in past but its kind of youve been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently you found that harder okay so i understand that you you first went to your gp he referred you here about two months ago can i ask what what led you to go to gp in first place \\s patient: my long term boyfriend broke up with me it was such shock like i really wasnt expecting it its got me really down felt really lonely i didnt really want to see people she wanted baby in space mom told me i should probably go to doctors he her family to you \\s therapist: okay so it sounds like you had that breakup you werent expecting it so kind of came out of blue bit that youve been on your own quite lot so youre not been seeing people as much it sounds like your mom notice that theres been bit of change in you okay how things been then since then since that happened since you went to gp \\s patient: i just nothings really changed nothings really improved i feel down like absence feel distant from things like i said i cant stop all over \\s therapist: okay how did you feel about coming here today \\s patient: i was kind of disappointed in myself because i feel like maybe else my ages doing this like i should have been able to snap out of it like its just another thing that ive not really affects me make me stand out for wrong reasons \\s therapist: okay so you feel like its kind of odd or unusual to be here coming to see clinical psychologist i suppose i just want to reassure you that its absolutely normal to have feelings of depression anxiety its really very common it certainly isnt auto strange at all so it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today so what i guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was lot pushing you against coming here today but youve managed to come anyway \\s patient: im just hoping that its going to help i think i didnt i didnt really want to admit it because like its just another failure but my mom was talking to me shes shes not really happy with way im behaving i dont really want to disappoint her again so i thought theres no harm in this \\s therapist: so sounds like partly youre doing it then your mum because youre bit worried that she she isnt pleased with you at moment \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay i think its great that youve come here definitely theres lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression particularly type of therapy that were going to be doing which called cognitive behavior therapy ill tell you bit more about that as we go on but im just trying to find out bit more about you today so i saw from your notes that your medic student \\s patient: yeah not currently in unii room but yeah last year as medical student \\s therapist: okay so i guess what why whats whats reason that youre not in uni this year \\s patient: i like he pretty tall fast as then suggested i took year out this break \\s therapist: okay so just thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough \\s patient: yeah was that i thought we still for everyone but obviously well take it in different ways daily \\s therapist: youre planning on panning on returning \\s patient: yeah i am gonna have to really so yeah \\s therapist: dont sound too sure about that though \\s patient: i think return probably thats whats gonna make everyone happy i think you know at least ill be able to finally achieve something get something right so yeah like next year im going to get through it yeah \\s therapist: okay so it doesnt it doesnt sound like you want to go back \\s patient: i do i do enjoy it i just i just dont feel like mate main man i just its lot of flack lot of pressure but thats what comes with it you know itll work out for best if i go \\s therapist: okay so i guess in theres quite lot of thoughts feelings about going back at moment im just wondering in meantime what are you what are you up to what have you been doing \\s patient: ive not really had much on horizon men more men have friends owns restaurant like she suggested that did better way to sit in there just deliver bit like money stuff because ive seen that in uni so you know ive done that \\s therapist: okay how many shifts have you done there \\s patient: ive only done one so far yeah i dont know whether its something that id probably go back to but \\s therapist: okay how when was that shift \\s patient: it was last week actually \\s therapist: okay how was it i suppose im intrigued can you tell me bit more about that \\s patient: umm it was it was different you know because it was like i could i did enjoy it because theres like its just different aspects i had to like speak to people like try to get their orders try to remember it stuff like i wasnt very good but i suppose like it was handy to have some money like get out of house \\s therapist: so it sounds like you quite enjoyed that then \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what makes you think you werent very good \\s patient: i just i just bit slow people sometimes they didnt stand by science so id have to talk louder or quieter or slower bit confused sometimes with orders then just dont really think that im not really like friendly like people dont really think that im friendly person they didnt really want to talk to me stuff i felt like i was like inconveniencing them by like asking them things getting things wrong but yeah they said they said that apparently most people got like few mistakes on fascia but then again shes my moms friend so probably why shes saying it \\s therapist: so person who owns restaurant your moms friend \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay so it says youre saying that you think you werent very good thats because youre bit slow you got confused with some orders \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: it you said its common for people to do that well on that first shift thats she said toes \\s patient: but but its probably just shes just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because im obviously not very good at it like im not very good for any things recently i think she just felt sorry for me \\s therapist: okay so ive just been noting down some of those thoughts that youve been having you kind of so you feel like youre not very good youre slow youre confused with orders you feel like youre inconveniencing her she feels sorry for you i suppose im wondering i mean what makes you think that she feels sorry for you \\s patient: like like such as my mothers friends shes obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because shes got daughter its not like anyone else who harried shes just like all alone shes not getting involved so i think she just feel sorry for me she doesnt want to extend until upset me yeah \\s therapist: when youre having these kind of thoughts because thats quite lot of negative thoughts youre describing how do you feel \\s patient: i feel empty i do im just calling as it just call it as reality i feel like im being honest with myself by just leasing it not trying to get around tighten it because no i can see myself \\s therapist: so it sounds like you feel like these thoughts are very true then i mean if youre going to write them so im going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe you said im not very good im inconveniencing them how much would you say you believe those on scale out of 100 where 100 like i absolutely believe it zeros like i dont believe it at all \\s patient: about 80 \\s therapist: so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay you said that when youre thinking those thoughts she started to feel quite empty \\s patient: i just feel just like sad im not really myself i just like its like im not really bad but when i am coming through good job \\s therapist: there any other emotions that you experience \\s patient: feel drained they feel like im in touch with anything just like everythings going on around me but im just not there im just if i can just walk in \\s therapist: okay so you feel empty distance you feel drained how when youre feeling these emotions how do you feel in your body kind of what sensations do you notice \\s patient: i didnt know how to describe it i got like i have bit of like we can have any kind of got like butterflies in your nerves stuff \\s therapist: did you have butterflies that night when youre at restaurant \\s patient: yeah i was pretty nervous then but when i got into it they went away like it just talked to me for bit so obviously i realized that i wasnt doing very good job \\s therapist: okay when you when you have these emotions how does it affect your energy levels do you feel more energetic less energetic or about same \\s patient: i am feeling down \\s therapist: yeah when youre having those emotions that you were describing \\s patient: i feel drained like then you will have like energy to wake up in morning sometimes because yll play less less than bodys having i dont want to \\s therapist: yeah sounds like you feel very tired youre struggling to wake up you said its pointless then what do you do then when you feel like that so i guess you just talked about when you wake up in morning you feel heavy i suppose youve been maybe having some of these thoughts those emotions potentially night before what do you then do how do you respond to that \\s patient: i just have to go expose that dont really have choice because my mom i live with my mom i know its hard for her so i dont want her to be too worried so i just i just tried to carry on as normal girl takes longer i dont want to but i do so now its my routine \\s therapist: so youre bit slower gets getting up \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: but you are still getting up anyway what about your kind of what do you think about when youre doing that \\s patient: im just thinking that nobody else like mate my age like maybe we should be feeling like this im only one that does \\s therapist: so it sounds like you think bit more about problem you kind of spend time thinking about hey how can it hapen to me \\s patient: i dont i dont want to feel like this but i do nobody else i know doors so it makes me feel even more alone gets me even more down i just dont display anyone i should have anyone to it \\s therapist: okay so it sounds like you try toughen up on yourself little bit tell yourself to work harder to be different okay when you start telling yourself that kind of thing how does that make you feel does that make you feel better afterwards or worse \\s patient: feels worse because it still cant snap out of it like im aware its happening i just im trying but i just cant then then its just another thing that im feeling just another thing that i cant really get",

            "therapist: how are you not well \\s patient: no \\s therapist: whats going on \\s patient: well remember i had told you that they were downsizing at my job \\s therapist: i remember that \\s patient: so i you know been there 20 years at my job yeah theyre downsizing lately they let me go \\s therapist: thats terrible im sorry to hear that \\s patient: no no no so yeah its just you know they let me go i have really nothing to go on i dont know what to do ive been at that job so long i really dont know how to do anything else \\s therapist: you should talk about job youre happy there \\s patient: yeah i was i thought you know i envision doing that job for long time so you know \\s therapist: thats not gonna happen no no how does this affect your financial outlook like your bills such \\s patient: oh its awful i mean we definitely my husband i its really spiraled out of control my husband i have kind of like joint we pay bills together so this was half of our income thats gone because it was kind of more sudden we didnt really have time to do anything else you know time to prepare \\s therapist: so it definitely caught you off guard do you have enough income with your husbands job to cover your basic bills \\s patient: were little bit yeah so far but if i dont find job soon then i dont know whats gonna happen i dont know how bad its gonna get \\s therapist: to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitments \\s patient: my husband usually deals with bills so im not quite sure but probably in another month or so its going to get really bad for about month \\s therapist: what thoughts have you been having \\s patient: all sorts i mean i ive worried that you know like my husband i are arguing because were under all this stress i worry were gonna lose our house you know im worried im going to be homeless you know its embarrassing i dont have job now what if i dont find another job you know what are my kids gonna do my kids are you know relying on us to meet their needs yeah yeah so i mean we could be homeless i might not ever get job again you know im not getting any younger so i just am afraid that i wont get another job \\s therapist: now you said you were laid off right \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: for position are you eligible for unemployment \\s patient: im not sure im still looking into that \\s therapist: because if you i mean im not labor law expert but i think if youre if youre laid off theres probably decent probability you could get on employment how much for educational \\s patient: i just have my bachelors \\s therapist: well thats thats more than most bachelors degree yeah you just havent had to look for job in long time right here because im guessing you thought youre gonna retire \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so this upsetting for lot of reasons so you have financial stressors right i cant be minimized relational stressors mentioned its kind of embarrassing yeah thats more like an identity thing i see identify with what you did right now you dont as much because youre not actively working in it yeah did you ever have any co workers who voluntarily left for other jobs \\s patient: not that no \\s therapist: not at time you worked there \\s patient: not that i was aware of that i think maybe it maybe like one while ago but it was pretty good job so \\s therapist: so lot of people stay \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: have you ever known anybody who worked for similar company or in same field who change jobs \\s patient: yeah one of my friends was in similar field he left job eventually found another job you know how long it took it took while it took while like maybe like two years or so at least almost yeah it was struggle for their family so i think about that \\s therapist: would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income \\s patient: i mean probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because you know we were comfortable way we were living so far would be ideal but you know we could probably survive on on part of it it just not as well as we were living \\s therapist: so weve talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions right so have you applied those concepts to whats going on now \\s patient: i mean ive been trying to think of think of you know different opportunities that might be open to me now you know being able to spend more time with my kids things like that ive been trying to think of it other ways my situation \\s therapist: so theres sort of an upside then sense time part at some point need to replace income yeah thats very pragmatic in money have you considered that if you attempted to seek full time job to work out you could look at part time jobs \\s patient: ive thought about it but im really having hard time with it \\s therapist: what would it what would it mean about you what would it say about you if you had to take part time job so finding another full time job so much of loss \\s patient: what would it mean about me that i think if i only had part time jobs that i wasnt qualified that i wasnt good enough for full time \\s therapist: so you would you would internalize that meaning would be that youre not as valuable \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so it speaks to self worth \\s patient: well right now its not good well i mean ive been arguing with my husband ive been drinking lot more you know depression has come back lot worse so its just starting to become cycle where you know drinking getting into arguments situations not getting better it just keeps snowballing keeps snowballing \\s therapist: yeah these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal so it kind of like self fulfilling prophecy element to this yeah do you agonize you worry invest in these thoughts right then to temporarily take away pain you drink yeah that ends up being more dysfunction right with relationship with your husband yeah imagine if youre intoxicated youre not looking for new work yeah that wouldnt be ideal timing so in sense youre youre not helping things to improve it all kind of starts without thinking \\s patient: but its hard when im really depressed situations not getting better im just home sitting about you know drinking while everyone else carrying on with their life im stuck here \\s therapist: that ties into that kind of worthless type five so youre fulfilling that role worthless that sounds manifesting for you thats one thing you can do thats an option you can drink you could have relational struggles but that really that really what you want at all that most useful \\s patient: really no its not helping \\s therapist: how do you think you could break that cycle \\s patient: ive been thinking about you know trying to get more organized like we talked about before with finances trying to you know figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want what to do maybe by baby steps so its not like so overwhelming for me like thought of getting new job making enough money providing for my family like breaking it down \\s therapist: well that makes sense yeah so first step would be figuring out what minimum amount you really need right so youll shoot for hire full time but you realize that you kind of need to know what minimum because you know what job offer you could accept in which i want free time to decline right so it makes sense so armed with that information you could go into workplace right it was less anxiety kind of just know this jobs gonna if i get it thats good right lord i might as well not apply to this one because its not gonna work so as efficient as time say its good that sounds logical \\s patient: i think just sometimes like fear of unknown like worry about what if this never happens for me you know what if i dont get job you know what if we lose our house \\s therapist: that worries yeah no worries nagging yeah yeah so \\s patient: i mean worst case if we dont get job i mean probably i dont know like get smaller house or find way around it i mean she would need to have some tough times \\s therapist: yeah it would be difficult right to be fair right it would be difficult but you would adapt \\s patient: right so like it would be difficult but i think if i really thought about it you know we would probably get through it \\s therapist: so if we pick up with that we say thats really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts right so if youre telling yourself that you have depression certainly anxiety craving to drink you tell yourself well worst that could happen i dont work rest of my life again acknowledging thats pretty unlikely but worst thing to happen i wont work again i might have to adapt i might have to have simpler life in terms of material goods small house but i would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood or your thoughts \\s patient: i mean i think when i really think about it you know like you said i think im less depressed or think that i you know im more able to cope with it you know knowing okay well this worst that could happen but maybe its not as bad as i thought would be embed \\s therapist: so theres piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what worst case scenario could be right probably another part of adaptive response could be you know i could live to worst case scenario i think its important to acknowledge that its unlikely thats unlikely right so statistics probability on your side here right so as you go out to workplace workforce seek employment youll probably have some some interviews we dont get job offers right but eventually if i have one where you do yeah right its its just math right if you can accept worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption reduce that depression anxiety \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so lets end there for today but i want you to try for next week i want to try plan that adaptive response right actually theres two were talking about right one you could survive worst case scenario other one that probabilistically it wont happen right so you have kind of two well you do have two adaptive responses i want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up like im never gonna work again okay this catastrophe so like that self talk yeah apply that self talk so identify that automatic thought because weve talked about that skill right then apply that self talk right away all right lets see you have thought record right so when that you know when you can fill one of those out okay when that happens when you have that automatic thought you apply adaptive response even if you cant get it completely filled out i understand that i know theres lot on there just what you can get done on that anything you can do that would be helpful \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: sound good \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so scheduled for one week so ill see you then well see how this goes to progress we can make on this on alcohol depression anxiety \\s patient: okay thanks",

            "therapist: elizabeth how you doing today \\s patient: um all right \\s therapist: how things been going since last time we met \\s patient: its about same im still feeling pretty down i mean i just feel really stuck not happy i just dont know why \\s therapist: okay so theres few things going on there you said you feeling stuck not happy some sound like little confused as to whats going on whats causing it you have any suspicions about what might be causing \\s patient: i mean ive been feeling like really isolated lately you know because im stay at home mom its hard theres not lot of people you know right at my fingertips to spend my time with you know obviously my family but um so i guess you know i kind of i had some friends in neighborhood but like our friendships just kind of fizzled out i ever since then its just like i dont really feel like doing much i just kind of feel like whats point let my husband take care of lot of stuff you know i used to you know shop for groceries all time make sure house always stocked make dinner every night get kids ready for school in morning i still do that stuff but lot of times you know i let it slide sometimes i wont make dinner or whatever when i do do it i just feel like im forcing myself to do it passion gone \\s therapist: how long have you been you say housewife right how long youve been housewife \\s patient: for long time i have two boys theyre eight 10 ive been staying home since my first one was born so 10 years you know its its been really rewarding for me im not really interested in going back to work or anything like that because i know people always say youre you know youre feeling unfulfilled like you should go back to work but its not it you know ive felt happy with it for so long i dont think that its being home i think its some thing inside of me \\s therapist: somethings changed so for long time you were satisfied in housewife you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life somewhere along line something changed in you now youre not happy with it so what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children shopping no thats what changed \\s patient: yeah exactly well i guess you know my youngest eight so hes only been in school for couple of years so i guess like its not super recent but recently he i finally have no children in home so its more its more time to myself i kind of fill that gap little bit with other things like i did cub scouts with boys for while like i said i had some friends around neighborhood so that kind of like fill that time but now that stuff its just not really happening anymore so now i kind of feel like its not its not boredom you know its not like i dont have enough to do its like i dont want to do anything but then at same time i feel frustrated because theres nothing to do \\s therapist: so youre youre frustrated with your situation maybe with yourself little bit \\s patient: yeah i think lot more with myself because i know that i would feel better if i you know maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time but i dont want to at same time so im frustrated with myself because i know i kind of know what would help but then i dont really have like volition to do it \\s therapist: youre not motivated \\s patient: yeahim not motivated \\s therapist: have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning has anyone else noticed that youre down \\s patient: yeah i mean obviously my husband has noticed because he has to get boys ready in morning hes really supportive i know he can tell that im not feeling same but you know he works then he has to come home pick up my slack so hes getting frustrated which i understand you know my mom has said to me that you know she thinks im not doing as much so it kind of hurts it feels like everybodys trying to tell me im lazy then im not doing enough its always that like feeling you know like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being mother but then at same time now that im doing less less i feel like theyre all right you know i am lazy im not doing anything \\s therapist: they used word lazy \\s patient: no no not that i can remember i you know i think my mom said like youre not doing as much as you used to i kind of took offense to that even though its kind of true its like i dont know it hurt \\s therapist: okay that was painful for you what about what your husband said \\s patient: you know i think at first we didnt really acknowledge it it was like you know i took break here he picked up slack it was fine but now that its been more hes kind of getting frustrated you know hes been asking me about how i feel why im not doing as much but at same time like even though he knows that im not motivated its still frustrating because i its my responsibility so i think hes you know hes been saying like i need you to do more around house pretty much what he said i need you to do more \\s therapist: what was your response to that when i said i need you to more \\s patient: i started crying because i know hes right thats what i tell myself every day i need to do more but i dont have motivation to do it so im so frustrated with myself you know i know that he needs that from me i dont know why im not motivated to do it \\s therapist: okay so youre frustrated forfeeling down \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youre frustrated for lacking motivation \\s patient: hmm \\s therapist: just as little as few years ago you didnt feel it this way at all \\s patient: yeah yeah i actually think you know ive been feeling this way more like in past like six months or something like that like i it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like natural way that it hard but this something else this more consuming its you know like difficulty of him going away to school almost was motivating like it was hard but at same time it was freeing because i had other opportunities to do stuff this just like stunting \\s therapist: okay so im gonna shift gears little bit can you tell me about your well recent day so its kind of typical what youre telling me now meaning not motivated down \\s patient: sure onn wednesday i was having really hard time getting out of bed so my husband just got kids ready in morning i felt really bad about that so i just stayed in bed for couple more hours probably until like 1030 i got up you know im made myself something to eat then i thought you know i should probably go to store because were almost out of milk you know i think boys need shampoo but i just i just sat down i just sat there i think i sat for i dont even know how long boys came home from school it was like you know 330 i hadnt even gotten up so then i said okay boys are home i should probably get started on dinner soon because my husband will be home soon i found i found something in fridge to make i made dinner you know after that everybody you know just sat down we just watch tv i just sat there until it was time to go to bed \\s therapist: this you said this was recently right \\s patient: ummhuhh \\s therapist: what would ideal day of look like take that same day do you wish you could have done \\s patient: i wish that i would wake up you know i would want to wake up when it was time for kids to get ready to school to go to school you know i could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed i could pay for lunches get boys dressed you know check they needed any permission slip sign that kind of thing send them out door then i would see if we needed anything from store i probably do little bit of cleaning around house i used to like have like list of chores that like i would do different things on different days different days of month stuff so like bedding would get washed one day in week that kind of thing so i would probably like follow that list nowadays i just you know if it gets done it gets done usually my husband helps me with some of stuff you know i would do bathrooms one day week that probably gets done like once month now but um i would do that so do cleaning if we if i needed to go to story we do that i get ready for boys to come home id probably make them snack figure out what was going to be for dinner i would go ahead do that then probably you know sometimes we we would watch tv after my husband got home after dinner or i would figure out something for us to do we could play board game or or watch movie as family or something like that that would be after kids did their homework everything like that then after we spent some time together i put them in bed \\s therapist: alright so its fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior where you want to be so let me ask you very specific question about one of first things in day you would mention that when it was time to get up right you did so you were awake aware of it but you went back to sleep of course your husband got up he took care of things \\s patient: right \\s therapist: how did you feel alone not to happen because clearly thats not what you want to happen how did you feel about oversleeping \\s patient: i just like you know alarm goes off i know its time to get up my husbands getting out of bed i just look at clock i think whats point you know its just this instant feeling of i cant even describe it like pointlessness of getting up so i go back to sleep but i feel worse for doing it you know like its catch 22 like i dont want to wake up i just dont want to but then when i go back to sleep i feel bad i feel guilty \\s therapist: okay so im not getting up in time you wanted you feel guilty but you also mentioned something that you thought which was if im not mistaken you said whats point can you expand on that \\s patient: it just its just like you know when im sleeping i dont realize how sad i am i dont realize how hard it to function when im sleeping im not aware of that as soon as i wake up i am so i just have this feeling of like whats point of getting up experiencing these feelings when i could go back to sleep not have to \\s therapist: whats point of getting up when sleeping pain at back \\s patient: yes yeah \\s therapist: okay but then when you when you do get up you feel sad guilty about having overslept \\s patient: yeah yeah definitely definitely \\s therapist: so really functionally what youre doing youre delaying experiencing pain \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: then in terms of how it affects your relationships your family youre not getting your kids off to school your husbands getting real frustrated \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all youve really bought yourself couple extra hours sleep you know presumably without without pain because youre sleeping but youre not really escaping it does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: before when you felt more satisfaction purpose did you get up help kids off to school \\s patient: yeah it was so easy i would just like you know i would wake up i would be like okay its time to get up get out of bed get ready to go i mean you know sometimes if if if i was little bit tired it would be little bit harder you know its not you know as stay at home mom i usually get enough sleep for most part now that kids are older everything so its not usually too hard to get up i would i would you know it would be another good day you know i would be glad to get up take care of things that i needed to take care of i felt accomplished \\s therapist: so maybe whats going on here or maybe maybe we could help you remember you know over last few sessions weve talked about cognitive behavioral therapy different techniques that ill be using different things were talking about sometimes with behavior behavior thats useful which in this case im assuming we can agree getting up on time behavior thats useful has to come first even if feeling doesnt match right so sleeping those extra i presume you couple hours delays you from feeling sad but it causes other problems if you were to get up one time you might still feel sad right because thats why youre over sleeping as youre sleeping longer to avoid that but functional part of being housewife as you identify would be completed so maybe some of those feelings of sadness guilt would over time abate because functionally speaking youre completing tasks that you want whats tough about that so in moment its easy for me to say this now but in moment like for instance when you have to get out of bed tomorrow youre going to be facing that same challenge which i can get up now feel depressed or i can wait feel depressed later so in that moment its hard to act on behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards i mean it sounds like you want to get up \\s patient: yeah i mean i want everything to be normal again i guess i never really thought of it like that like i just thought well if im waking up at right time im just feeling bad then like like i said whats point but i guess it makes sense like even if i dont feel like doing it maybe itll make me feel better if i do do it even if its hard because nothing really harder than when im already going through \\s therapist: well it seems like youre youre more or less making things worse right in an effort to avoid pain that youre going to suffer anyway youre making pain worse just delaying it little bit right what what thought we talked before about automatic thoughts these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have thought that this pointless right im going to expand on my thought little say that you know that thoughts really getting at i can avoid this pain if i sleep little while longer thats version of thought \\s patient: does that make sense also i guess i thought that no it wouldnt really be that beneficial to get up \\s therapist: okay so minimizing benefit \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so theres couple of things going on right i can avoid pain by slipping in theres really no point to getting out because i wont do any good anyway \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: what adaptive response that self talk we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves could you apply in that moment when youre you know whatever time you get up in morning when youre thinking about this that thought comes in that it doesnt really matter if i get up anyway \\s patient: i mean i guess i could tell myself like i can do this like instead of you know when i say to myself whats point instead i can say i can do this i can get out of it itll be okay i can im strong enough even though its hard to push through pain get up now even though i dont want to i can say i can do this \\s therapist: okay so that would be adaptive response im strong enough i can get through this but it will be difficult right how about value of getting up early seeing kids off to school automatic thought right now telling you thats not valuable but i think that you believe it valuable \\s patient: yeah i mean i know its valuable i guess what my frustration that i know its valuable it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like pride satisfaction now im not getting that anymore so i guess i need to realize that even though im not getting it right now if i keep trying maybe it will happen again because it did happen before \\s therapist: it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back if you do get up then if you guess thats true right \\s patient: so never get satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school \\s therapist: she had zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do \\s patient: i never thought about it like that \\s therapist: that kind of makes sense \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: so even though getting up early going to be painful seem like not practical move logically you know that has better chance of paying off for you i think that with with these type of what youre going through probably depression right now what i like to talk to you further to make sure thats whats going on seems like youre depressed sometimes with depression you just have to get one thing going your way each day right so so im not saying necessarily tomorrow you have to get up one time then go make new friends then go find social activities right you dont have to build rome in day here right its its more like can i do this one thing okay i proved to myself just what im saying which im strong enough to get up see kids often have that one victory for tomorrow right build on that \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s therapist: part of thats going to be playing those adaptive responses back right thinking of those thoughts whether its just thinking them you know in your mind or actually thinking them saying sometimes its helpful just to say them out loud \\s patient: not letting negative thoughts take over because thats what im thinking like okay i can get kids off to school but after that im going to start thinking you know whats point again like what why dont i just sit down theres just no point so if i can keep reminding myself that i just have to try that i did accomplish something then you know even though its hard i know that those thoughts are going to come back then im going to feel bad if i dont do anything im not going to feel any better \\s therapist: so you have good handle on adaptive responses sounds like right you know what you have to say after but you know what you want to do ill see again in week therell be five days in there between now my see again we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not right so i want you to give that tryto adaptive responses try to push through with that behavior now its important to keep in mind that we have five days between now i want to see you again in five business days right school days you may not succeed every day thats okay right \\s patient: hmmm \\s therapist: sometimes setbacks like you could you could get up early two days in row then it goes up back up third day dont let that will wash away those successes its day by day fight try not to think of it in terms of week i want you to try to think of it in terms of what i have to do today not worrying about future not worrying about should done in past \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: only moment we really can live in now so try to stay in present moment recite those adaptive responses try to push for that just that one victory okay can you try that \\s patient: yeah i think i can try that \\s therapist: all right so work on that to continue with homework that maybe cbt homework havent given you ill see you next week \\s patient: thank you \\s therapist: thanks",

            "therapist: afternoon im glad you could get in today \\s patient: im still anxious \\s therapist: yes last week when you were you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety we had developed plan plan for your anxiety according to my notes you were going to look into some yoga classes you were going to attempt to drink less coffee you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in home you were going to spend more time in nature so im wondering how all that went \\s patient: well i looked at gym there werent really any yoga classes so i didnt i didnt really do that i did cut back on my coffee little bit but i just find that it wakes me up in morning so you know ive cut back to one cup instead of two cups i did take dog for walk but i havent really gotten out other than that \\s therapist: okay so it sounds like youve made some movement forward towards your goals you did at least look into yoga even though gym didnt have yoga classes you did cut down from two cups of coffee to one you did get out with your dog in nature for walk but it sounds like you had little bit of an issue getting out more with people \\s patient: yeah i dont i dont really like to go out with people theres usually lot of lot of chatter lot of talking its hard for me to be in \\s therapist: so its uncomfortable for you to be to around people with all speaking chatting talking how does that make you feel \\s patient: it just makes me feel little bit nervous then when i get out there i dont really i dont really engage in conversation \\s therapist: okay so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious so im wondering what we could do about that \\s patient: im not really sure maybe i could invite people over instead \\s therapist: that would absolutely be one option you could invite people over to your house then you could get to choose who youre around \\s patient: yeah thats good idea \\s therapist: in terms of yoga lets get back to yoga for minute tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes \\s patient: well i just looked at my gym i didnt really look anywhere else because im already paying to go to gym i dont really want to pay extra to go somewhere else so thats why i didnt really look anywhere else \\s therapist: mm hmm so if i were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find yoga class on scale of one to 10 \\s patient: maybe about five or six \\s therapist: okay \\s patient: um well i i see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga i see all these pictures i just want to do it so im interested in doing it its just really hard \\s therapist: so when you see pictures on your newsfeed it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it it makes it more challenging \\s patient: well i havent done it before so its little bit hard to get out there because i dont think im as flexible other people \\s therapist: mm hmm so youre thinking that youre not as flexible as other people im wondering if thats what yoga about flexibility \\s patient: well i think i think that people go to become flexible but i think that maybe some people are already just flexible \\s therapist: mm hmm so you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as rest \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: youd be beginner \\s patient: well im worried i wouldnt be able to do poses in class \\s therapist: okay so what do you think would happen if you couldnt do poses in class \\s patient: well i feel embarrassed i think then if teacher tried to get me to do it everybody else would see that theyre trying to get me into pose i think it would be embarrassing \\s therapist: okay so youd be embarrassed if you couldnt do certain policies how would you feel if you could do all poses in class \\s patient: i think i feel really good \\s therapist: so what do you think it preventing you from not doing all poses in class \\s patient: right i guess its just embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it \\s therapist: what would what would cause you to not being able to do it \\s patient: causes are not were not sure okay \\s therapist: i remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible im wondering what would make that difference between then now \\s patient: well when i was kid i used to just practice stretch lot now that i dont i dont have same flexibility mm hmm so as ive gotten older ive lost lot of flexibility \\s therapist: how would it be if you couldnt do all poses in class you did get embarrassed you just let it be embarrassed \\s patient: i mean it would be okay but i dont i dont like that feeling \\s therapist: what would be payoff do you think if you put up with little bit of embarrassment \\s patient: well i probably feel really good in end \\s therapist: you know i can give you ive lots of studies that i can give you videos that i can show you of people that started yoga started practicing yoga their anxiety went way down as matter of fact some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased same as medications so im not sure if you were if you knew that or not \\s patient: i didnt really know that i just thought that that youll go was for about flexibility i didnt realize there were so many other benefits \\s therapist: okay so how motivated would that make you feel on scale of one to 10 \\s patient: well i probably if i thought that id be it would make me less anxious i think id probably be around an eight or nine \\s therapist: good good thats definite improvement you could determine after that first class whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not that would that be validation for you or would that be it gives you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after yoga class \\s patient: i think that would be lot of motivation to continue \\s therapist: okay so one other thing that i wanted to to mention to you was you said that youd walk your dog in nature curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature wow \\s patient: it was only about 30 minutes it was really cold windy so we didnt want to stay out by we i mean dog i mm hmm \\s therapist: so because of it it was cold windy you decided to kind of cut walk short yeah thats definitely understandable im wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking dog in day \\s patient: wow it might help if i take jacket next time \\s therapist: okay so if you took jacket in cases cold yeah do you have special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be in that would help you even more enjoy it \\s patient: as long as im just away from road noise traffic then its lot better okay theres lots of trails around my house like that okay \\s therapist: excellent its great that you have trails around your house where youre not exposed to all that noise \\s patient: probably \\s therapist: on scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means \\s patient: its probably attend i can i can commit to that \\s therapist: okay all right so it sounds like last week you had few problems carrying out assignments towards decreasing your anxiety you really couldnt find yoga class because youre already signed up for gym that doesnt have yoga classes but you already know about yoga videos that ive sent you so you could actually do them at home \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home \\s patient: if i could do them at home i would probably do them all time mm hmm i think that would be big difference \\s therapist: then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldnt do poses less coffee youve gone from two cups to one cup thats very good get out more with people youve decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing whos going to be in your space thats always an apprehensive moment when you dont know you have no control over whos going to be in your space on scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour day walking with dog \\s patient: i think its 10 i think i can do them on all four all four \\s therapist: fabulous how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of course of next week how much of difference do you think it would make you feel \\s patient: perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if i were doing them on regular basis mm hmm \\s therapist: how would it make you feel \\s patient: it would make me feel really good \\s therapist: so youd feel relaxed you would feel more positive i think you would do \\s patient: thank you so much",
            "The patient feels anxious. The patient hasn't done yoga classes, cut back on coffee a bit to one cup and taken dog out for a walk. The patient does not like chattering people so find hard to go out with people. One idea discussed was to invite people over home. The patient explains they would feel embarassed if they are not able to do yoga poses. The therapist clarifies yoga reduces anxiety a lot and the patient readily agrees to it. The next idea was to use jacket and take trails around the house that are less noisy for walking the dog. The therapist suggests to do yoga poses at home and that would be no embarassment. The patient confidently agrees they can do all of them on a regular basis. "

            "therapist: alisa how you doing today \\s patient: good how are you \\s therapist: im doing well thanks for asking \\s therapist: how has anxiety been going \\s patient: um since last session it seems to be in check \\s patient: nothing really major its been going on with it so i think \\s patient: im getting to point where its under control \\s therapist: i subsided bit thats good yeah thats good hows things been going at work lately \\s patient: so works little bit of different story um we have our daily meetings i actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because i feel like they undermine me all time they like they dont give me respect basically that i deserve so i took her outside after meeting lean into her about it afterwards i mean next day because we have these things every day she like she came back came at me again but it was worse even after talking for \\s patient: no \\s therapist: so you have these someone understands you have these daily meetings right you mentioned that shes not showing you respect that you deserve respect right effect so tell me tell me about that believe from what we talked about abc before activating events beliefs consequences in our abt tell me about that belief \\s patient: or i just feel that i do good job i deserve to be respected by my coworkers yeah it just \\s therapist: other levels of respect theres certain level of respect that you demand or need \\s patient: i dont know if theres certain level but i feel just like i deserve it you know \\s therapist: what did she do that kind of convinced you that she wasnt meeting that level of respect \\s patient: well she was like she doubt my ideas um just kind of made me feel like fool basically so i just i didnt understand \\s patient: right \\s patient: i mean i guess \\s therapist: have you criticized other coworkers \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within what youve kind of seen there regularly \\s patient: i mean now that you pointed out i mean i guess i can view it in that way that it wasnt \\s patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were \\s patient: yeah \\s patient: i mean i guess i may have gone out or little partially um but i felt at time that it was reasonable \\s therapist: at time when you were \\s patient: when i was talking to her outside of meeting \\s therapist: so you felt that she was bit harsh you talk to her about it but then shes become more harsh so where do you stand with her now like meeting well \\s patient: ive just been trying not to talk to her obviously in work situation doesnt really help \\s therapist: its not convenient yeah it might not help alright so lets work this through using abc model that we use for anxiety that you had before right that was troublesome to you before what would activating event be here in this situation \\s patient: so i guess confrontation i had whether \\s therapist: was this criticism \\s patient: yeah yeah \\s patient: so she criticized me i felt disrespected \\s therapist: thats feeling \\s patient: i feel or my my belief that i deserve respect \\s patient: being upset like disrespected again yeah \\s therapist: was aggravation yeah frustration frustration so thats that would be one of consequences of how you processed her behavior does that make sense feeling frustration feeling would be one of consequences like an abc kind of chance you have activating event she criticizes you your belief that you deserve respect clearly she violated that belief right she she didnt show you respect that you deserved record your belief system one of consequences therefore was this feeling of frustration were there any other consequences \\s patient: well if we like go forward its kind of disarray or tension i guess you know in office \\s therapist: to get thats thats definitely consequence im thinking theres an intermediate consequence stuff so you had that feeling of frustration whats next thing you did after that meeting was over \\s patient: like confronted her \\s therapist: you confronted her right so you have kind of those two consequences that confrontation it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms which another activating event you could also think of as consequence but like i said this cyclical so you see how b c paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you \\s therapist: does that make some some sense \\s patient: it does yeah i mean when you put it that way then you say its cyclical then you just i can see i can visualize that going around my carousel \\s therapist: sure exactly so it helps you to kind of see what caused what maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in future right so we cant go back change that but we can work on future so her criticism of you theres no direct way to change that consequences consequences that leaves belief system right which deserving respect right one of things we try to do in our abt help people move from rigid thinking to more flexible thinking \\s therapist: so kind of rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way but you know i i demand deserve respect right at this particular level people arent meeting it right would you say thats fair \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: okay maybe more flexible way of thinking would be that youd like respect respects good yeah respects healthy work environments certainly but if you dont get it you can still function its tough for you i can see thats tough tell me about that \\s patient: i mean i understand but youre saying i get it i guess its just kind of like anxiety with anxiety we worked on its just getting there \\s therapist: mm hmm do you are you willing to think of challenge your beliefs in this instance \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: yeah tough though just as you mentioned like what inside says tough how long have you had this belief cuz mentality of i deserve respect \\s patient: oh gosh um since i was like teenager so long time \\s therapist: this has been relatively persistent part of your life lets play system so changing its going to be work \\s therapist: so if you can apply different philosophy apply more flexible thinking next time youre in meeting she still criticized you in meetings \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: so if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be im being disrespected again i it probably comes on that way you kind of feel it \\s patient: yeah it it starts in my stomach then goes all way up \\s therapist: so itll be your first physiological reaction right emotional reaction but if you can kind of pause that moment apply more flexible thinking like i talked about right which id like respect right but i can survive function without it at some level i can accept that im not going to get it all time other other areas of life for you do get respect \\s patient: yeah for my friends my family i feel i feel like they give me its actually mutual respect they give me respect i give them respect \\s patient: well i think \\s patient: over time if i learned to do that i first starting like within side of me like i wouldnt get that initial like \\s patient: punched in gut \\s patient: i wouldnt have urge to lash out at her especially if it trying to be constructive criticism resulting in situation where theres that tension in our office \\s patient: id be able to do that i \\s patient: think id be able to approach her maybe ask her shed want to get coffee or something maybe sit down kind of \\s patient: talking with her \\s patient: maybe i misunderstood her in first meeting she really didnt mean to undermine me as i said \\s patient: then go from there \\s therapist: so either way gathering information meaning having discussing discussion with her it would be helpful because i mean you may find that you really see things so like it was just disagreement in terms of her criticism in way you interpreted or she may have been trying to be critical youll know that to be really cant control someone elses behavior but it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions \\s patient: yeah i certainly dont want like our upper management to you know get involved therell be bigger issue \\s therapist: you dont want them to have to come sort that out right you can sort out their own that would be good application of coping skills flexible thinking so that something you feel like you can try over course of next week \\s patient: i will definitely try \\s therapist: so really our plan move forward as couple parts so one would be smooth things over sensitive discussing this with her letting her know youre aware whats going on you want to try to resolve it second part would be trying to move little bit away from rigid you know i deserve respect to i would like respect but ill function adequately without respect from everyone i know thats tough thats gonna be thats gonna be challenge right but this will be this will give us good information give you some practice does it all make sense to you \\s patient: yeah its pretty clear you explained it really well thank you \\s therapist: so lets work on those two those two elements right next time you come in well check in on those two make any needed modifications to our strategy well kind of move forward from there \\s patient: okay \\s therapist: that sounds good \\s patient: sounds great \\s therapist: thanks lisa \\s patient: thanks",

about \\s therapist: you came in to see one of my colleagues recently didnt you \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: she sent you for blood test \\s patient: thats right doctor \\s therapist: yeah we think he might be anemic \\s patient: oh gosh yes \\s therapist: what i want to do today was firstly to give you blood test result then talk to you little bit about condition of anemia then talk about some potential treatments \\s patient: so right up to dear \\s therapist: does that sound okay with you \\s patient: that sounds fine yes doctor \\s therapist: great so should we have look at your blood test yes yeah here it so what were testing for level of hemoglobin in your blood right just to show you normal range for women between 115 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin right this your level of hemoglobin its 87 \\s patient: all that slows \\s therapist: its bit lower than we would like so what were looking to do to get that back within normal range right just to reassure you iron deficiency anemia which i think youve got fairly common up to around 15 of women can experience this type of anemia \\s patient: right \\s therapist: its very treatable as well yeah \\s patient: yeah oh yes i mean this tightness so its just just getting me down doctor \\s therapist: i must be because youve got quite busy lifestyle \\s patient: yes yeah i just cant cope with it \\s therapist: okay yeah shall i tell you bit more about anemia do you know anything about condition \\s patient: i dont know i mean ive heard of it but i dont know what it \\s therapist: it condition relates to your blood right within your blood theres several components one of which plasma within plasma you have your red blood cells within that you have protein called hemoglobin which carries oxygen around your body to all different organs okay now if thats not working efficiently you start to experience kind of symptoms that youve been having like breathlessness dizziness tiredness \\s patient: yeah definitely yes \\s therapist: one of causes can be blood loss so i wondered about your periods how are they \\s patient: well theyve been heavy these last few months really heavier i pass it down to my age you know this stuff getting irregular heavy but you might be right \\s therapist: yeah that may be fact yeah yeah so i want to talk to you about treatments now there are couple of things that i would suggest that you try first thing wed like to do to increase amount of iron in your diet can you tell me bit about sort of diet you have at moment \\s patient: so i mean im really busy i think they have reasonable you know well balanced diet we eat lot of ready meals then on weekend we always have good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so i think its quite good diet rightyes \\s therapist: teenage children they keep you busy \\s patient: oh they do yes i mean you know its like having taxi service you know what with that then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired im just getting tired \\s therapist: it must be hard for you to do all those things \\s patient: yes yeah its difficult i just feel yourself cant cope anymore \\s therapist: yeah now you mentioned ready meals i can understand you relying on those for convenience but problem sometimes you dont get proper balance of nutrients \\s patient: all right doctor \\s therapist: so what id ask you to do perhaps to adapt your diet slightly include more iron rich foods in your diet \\s patient: oh right okay \\s therapist: before i tell you about what some of those foods are can ask if youre vegetarian \\s patient: no no \\s therapist: you know reason i asked that because one of best sources of iron in your diet lean red meat \\s patient: oh yes yeah youre nice day \\s therapist: yeah exactly also liver good source of iron \\s patient: no no no no couldnt eat liver \\s therapist: what about something like steak that you mentioned would you consider eating that bit more regularly \\s patient: well yes i mean state one day to kaku toll you know because now to go good yes yeah \\s therapist: theres also leafy green vegetables things like kale spinach good source of iron \\s patient: ohh kids wouldnt eat that but i mean they like sweet corn so they can have sweet conch they were same i could go for leafy green vegetables broccoli so theres broccoli \\s therapist: yes yeah i like broccoli you know \\s patient: ohh good good i would go with that \\s therapist: theres other things too you might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron \\s patient: what are those \\s therapist: well if you look on ingredients panel cereals youll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those \\s patient: oh yes yes ill look in supermarket i mean ive got some of those we could have tweak that gives me more time to cook or die \\s therapist: could make your life bit easier \\s patient: yeah definitely i would be happy to vote yes \\s therapist: white bread good source of iron as well \\s patient: yes yeah no they only like white bread only buy white bread but i could buy myself some brown bread cobs have it for lunch yes yeah no good \\s therapist: so do you think you could give some of those things try \\s patient: yeah i would try doctor definitely \\s therapist: right yeah its other thing id like you to consider taking course of iron tablets \\s patient: oh im not into tablets why \\s therapist: okay this can be really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia what it does it supplements amount of iron iron youre getting in your diet \\s patient: so will that be short term \\s therapist: yes yes often people respond very well to those you can have some side effects sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on you know on an empty stomach so do you take them after meal \\s patient: all right you how to remember to do that yes yeah \\s therapist: i think those two things adapting your diet taking course of iron tablets i think he might respond very well to treatment \\s patient: yes yeah have go doctor \\s therapist: how do you feel about information ive given you so far outside \\s patient: yes ill definitely try if it makes me feel any better its worth it \\s therapist: yes excellent yeah excellent ive given you quite lot of information about anemia today ive got leaflet here about anemia which i thought you might like to take home read in your own time \\s patient: ohh thank you yes yeah oh yes yeah ill read this talk this sometimes difficult to remember what what your tells so yes having look at this at home would be really helpful \\s therapist: thats right \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: thats right so just to check that ive explained things to you correctly that you could just recap on two treatments that youre going to try \\s patient: what you said that navy was due to lack of iron i can get this from having some red meat i mean steak lamb chops would that be \\s therapist: yeah \\s patient: yeah green vegetables wholemeal bread have these iron tablets you know hopefully ill feel better thank you \\s therapist: yes excellent so what id like you to do come back in couple of weeks then we can see how youre doing \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: have you got any questions \\s patient: are there any other tests ill have to have \\s therapist: i think at this stage when you come back to see me again well do another blood test check on your hemoglobin level than if you havent if it hasnt gone back into normal range it might be then that we look at doing some other investigations but i dont want to worry about that at this stage i think lets see how you do with dietary change in iron tablets we can discuss that next time \\s patient: all right thank you yes \\s therapist: there anything else \\s patient: no i think thats it thank you \\s therapist: okay well good to see you ill see you again in few weeks \\s patient: okay thank you \\s therapist: bye \\s patient: bye",

means he needs to go out joe not going to be home for hours you really dont want to take him out but you have to it makes you sick tired upset because youre not going to use gloves that you always use when you have to take them out so you walk toward door you think well maybe ill just make them wait but you realize how wake baby up if you dont take so you go toward leash it just makes you even more anxious to see it its dirty its chewed up its gross you see stains on it you think about what those are from maybe theyre from dog poop thats going to get on you you pick it up anyway snap it on his collar as you go out door he lunges outside he pulls that leash into your hand you feel contamination from leash entering your body through pores of your skin you feel like its just running up your arm through your bloodstream you keep thinking oh my god what if i get sick from this what if what if theres some germs in this or bacteria but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do bring him back inside house take leash off urge to wash so powerful so strong you want to go scrub your hands get in shower wash your whole body do it quickly get all these terms off from leash but you dont do that you know to make yourself not do ritual then you go back in then just keep doing housework keep doing things but thats sense of feeling sick staying with you worrying about whats

patient: yeah \\s therapist: could you tell me about those \\s patient: yeah probably for last eight months maybe year even you know i have this position at work where i have to make these weekly presentations its killing me i cant do it anymore \\s therapist: tell me about how these presentations are set up \\s patient: so its its its executive director its 10 managers were kind of sitting in circle everybody goes around does like weekly program update five minutes or so maybe 10 at most if theres an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted but everybody takes turns speaking it goes around kind of around in circle you know depending on where you said what order you present basically \\s therapist: you say that this situation presentation you said its killing you \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: would feeling so you have \\s patient: i feel like its constantly on my mind constantly worried about this presentation even though i only have to speak for like five minutes im so consumed by by this part of my job that i cant i cant do anything else i normally feel like i do good in my job but but this you know it just it builds up more like every day day before really bad because im prepping for meeting so it really starts to consume me then i dont sleep night before then by time you know i get to meeting im im so anxious so nervous im panicking everything i just cant i just cant \\s therapist: so so this this distressing for you \\s therapist: this probably difficult to to talk about beginning of meeting what would be your anxiety level whats going on then \\s patient: by beginning of meeting when ive sat down im im i feel like im breathing harder im starting to sweat i feel like my face turning red my palms are really sweaty costly having to wipe them off on my pants i my heart racing i feel like you know closer it gets to being my turn i feel like everything just gets worse i feel like im breathing harder my heart beating faster louder i feel like everybody can hear it my stomach just gets in knots i feel nauseous i cant you know there have been times that ive managed to like just hold my hand still just sit really still ive tried some deep breathing just satin have made it through i have have made it to my my presentation been able to speak but even then when i speak i stutter i stammer over my words i dont say everything i need to even i have cheat sheet essentially i can reframe it i still feel like im missing things im leaving things out my voice doesnt project so i end up speaking very softly like i said im stuttering i just cant get it even then its its still i feel like its still mess \\s therapist: youre not youre not happy with quality of your prison now even even when youre able to kind of stay there conducted so i want to divide this into stages so we talked about very beginning so youre already having anxieties sounds like its fairly intense at that point tell me about as they go around table give their brief presentations tell me about what youre feeling as as presentations come around to you \\s patient: well if i if i manage somehow to get there early enough i can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss or like like one or two away then im actually pretty okay because i can i can kind of get it over done but so many times im so nervous honestly bit hungover because ive been drinking too to try i dont feel anxious want to drink so there have been lot of times that ive ive woken up little bit late because ive been drinking so by time i get there like one of last its one of last seats so im one of last to go so as it gets closer closer to me i just feel more more anxious panicky here in especially in last few weeks ive had to leave i can say ive got to go \\s therapist: so before before presentations come around to you you get up yeah leave room so in those times when youve stayed in room youve done presentation so anxiety anxiety panic heart rate sweaty palms all these

this right i mean normal people can make these presents like rest of staff can do it why cant i so i dont want to tell him that you know i that theres something wrong with me i mean its its gotten to point that ive talked to him about you know this other position thats in another department transferring so that i wouldnt have to do this anymore it would it would be pay cut i mean its demotion but i cant live like this \\s therapist: this too painful if you had other job his other job would involve presentations so youd be happier youd have fewer symptoms in that job whats been result of that discussion has there been anything has happened as far as well \\s patient: he has told me that he thinks something in good job \\s patient: excuse me he doesnt want me to heres what im going to change positions but i cant i cant do this anymore \\s therapist: all right so youve youve tried you try to cope with anxiety youve had to leave colon colon sick or come in late youve looked for

unhappy that you were you were drinking now youre more or less something that you dont have strong feelings about one way or other \\s patient: i guess i just dont know why i should keep suffering like making myself suffer \\s therapist: so drinking tastes was suffering \\s patient: no feeling bad about drinking makes me suffer \\s therapist: feeling bad about drinking \\s patient: yeah i mean yes drinking takes away suffering but thats not what i meant \\s therapist: so feeling guilty about drinking thats whats caused you problems \\s patient: that i mean i dont know if thats whats causing me problems but at this point it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what im saying \\s therapist: how would you like to feel bad \\s patient: i would like to not i would like to be happy i would like to not drink i would like to have good life but at this point id rather just i dont know like why should i keep feeling guilty about it what point like what point of this life where i have no job im gonna lose my house you know i just dont get it like why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else not working its not working so im just supposed to like keep trying i dont get that anymore i dont get it \\s therapist: so you no longer understand point of life \\s patient: yeah i mean yeah as it like this just doesnt make any sense to me like why should i keep fighting to be sober if i cant you know i lost my job its too late for that like whole point of coming to you to you know have better life things are getting worse im not saying its your fault im just saying like whats point of this if its not getting better things are getting so bad that even if i was sober i wouldnt be able to handle it \\s therapist: so what do you see as your options right now \\s patient: i dont know \\s therapist: you tell me about some things youve been doing recently like in last three or four days \\s patient: sitting at home

my responsibility \\s therapist: whats your responsibility right now \\s patient: nothing nothing i mean \\s therapist: so no one would correct me if im wrong no one would care if you die \\s patient: i mean they probably care little bit do i care if they care no \\s therapist: so you care little but youre not concerned with that you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because youve lost job now soon your house you have anything else that you care about any goals \\s patient: i used to \\s therapist: how about now \\s patient: no \\s therapist: what happened to your goals \\s patient: i drank them i lost my job i lost my house but you know i was thinking maybe i could find myself new job but at this point im just so far gone like my life so ruined i dont know how you could

you cant see what to do that now \\s patient: no \\s therapist: i mean come on cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you \\s patient: i dont know i mean happened to me did to myself its just at this point its like ive lost so much have what i worked for i dont have one scrap of dignity or anything at all i dont have anything \\s therapist: you dont have anything you dont have any worth worthless thats how youre feeling \\s patient: yeah alone worthless yeah like nothing theres nothing redeemable theres nothing i can build upon \\s therapist: have you been thinking about ending your life are you hesitant to tell me that \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: why that \\s patient: i guess lot of reasons i know that we have worked together i dont want you to feel like you failed i really dont want you to try to do anything because i feel like nothing that you have tried has worked you know im hopeless case \\s therapist: hmmm \\s patient: i feel like at this point it shouldnt even be your responsibility to try because its not fair to you anymore i dont know i just oh \\s therapist: youre planning on ending your life ideal plan in place \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: can you tell me about plan \\s patient: i dont really want to talk about it \\s therapist: but you have plan you dont want me to interfere in your plan \\s patient: no no obviously not \\s therapist: but youre aware that im going to try to interfere with your plan \\s patient: i get i guess so \\s therapist: you mentioned earlier that you just i mean it sounds like youre saying youve hit rock bottom rock bottom cant be tolerated your family would care if they lost you but youre indifferent to that right i would care if you die all right im gonna do everything i can to prevent that its hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness its hard to see stress but i see somebody with strengths i see young lady that over last few months has told me all kinds of strengths all kinds of situations where youve been resilientyou recall those conversations \\s patient: i guess \\s therapist: but thats not in forefront of your mind right now youre strange but theyre still there do you have an intent to commit suicide \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: you dont want me to stop here \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: im going to stop you right i want to im obligated to its really best thing to be done to prevent it i know you feel this way now i know i cant fully understand that but im fairly sure that you wont feel this way week or two from now right feelings of worthlessness feelings of hitting rock bottom they cycle just like all feelings right youve had ups downs before remember \\s patient: yes \\s therapist: i see some of long productive life suicides not its not answer i know it seems like only option right now i get that but theres still some other options does that make sense \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: i know you probably dont wanna hear about other options i think what we should do today get you over as an impatient alright go pi keep you for 510 days kind of work on getting your mood stable my guess when you come out youll feel differently on this subject youll feel little better maybe feel little better place we can continue we will ill see you will schedule associate that on day or day after you come out right preferably on same day does that make sense to you \\s patient: i mean i guess \\s therapist: are you disappointed im trying to save your life \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: do you understand why im doing it \\s patient: yeah \\s therapist: all
